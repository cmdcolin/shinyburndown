2388,"Create ""quickstart list"" on jbrowse-desktop which users can add to",open,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-10-07T16:55:08Z,2021-10-07T21:26:36Z,,"Concepts

1) Downloads https://jbrowse.org/genomes/sessions.json at electron app startup, using code in electron.ts
2) Splits the sessions.json file (containing multiple assemblies, etc) into separate files in ~/.config/@jbrowse/desktop/quickstarts/hg19.json, hg38.json, etc.
3) Users can add their own files to the quickstart list by using a star icon on the recent session panel
4) Users can delete and rename quickstarts
5) Deleted quickstarts get a '.deleted' file added e.g. hg19.json.deleted which means, they can delete things that would come from the sessions.json
6) The quickstart list is updated in the GUI every 500ms. This is easier and maybe even better than designing an observable/reactive system because it is hard to design a reactive system based on the filesystem, and often polling is the best way here (even typescript does polling on a large scale).

Typescript doesn't really follow semver, so it's not really much of a thing, but notable changes include: more monitoring of using `delete` operator, more bug fixes and improvements as usual, and caught exception type is set to `unknown` (previously typescript was type `any`). The catch type unknown is the most visible change, and this unknown type is  propagated throughout the code (setError et al are set to receive an unknown, and in the end, normally just stringifies it)

One idea for desktop that has been discussed is to make desktop sessions be contained in a single file, and the user chooses where that file is saved. That differs from the current model where sessions are auto-saved in a hidden user config directory.

The user choosing where the file was saved would be similar to them choosing where a Word document they were working on was saved. This way they could know where their sessions are and e.g. easily be able to find and attach them for debugging purposes.

This would also allow us to open JBrowse by double-clicking the session file in the file system."

- Reduce size of saved session thumbnail image. Now saves at a width of 250 (the size of the preview image in the card) instead of full window width.
- Fix bug in mm10 preloaded config where it would not open by itself because it didn't have a defaultSession
- Fix bug where if you checked and then un-checked an assembly, it would still be in the session (also disable ""Go"" button while no assemblies are checked)
- Move tooltip on toggle button from the contents to the toggle button itself, so that the tooltip will show up even if hovering over the edges of the button.
- Rename ""table view"" to ""list view"" in start screen. Small survey (at least my OS's file explorer and Google Drive) shows this to be the commonly used term.

Notes

- There are now many more release artifacts, the blockmap files, the latest-*.yml files are needed for auto-update

- The mac needs both a dmg and a zip because without the zip it gives an error to the auto-updater (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/2199). Zip could also be used separate from dmg e.g. like a non-installer

- Bumps requirement for the monorepo to node 14 because electron-builder needs it. I could revert this particular change but it seems best to stay updated, and this just requires node 14 via the engines field

- Adds snap and appimage options for linux. AppImage was what previously was only available, but snap might help a subset of users

I've been including a lot of data sets in the same environment, causing my json.config file to be pretty large (>2000 lines) and unorganized. Once you have 3, 4, ... subcategories per feature track, it make more sense to manually edit the config files (copy/paste + edit) rather than use the build in jbrowse functions. It would be nice to have one 'master' config file, where you can link several 'child' config files. This would enable structured data to be organized better, and is especially interesting when working with multiple researchers/bioinformaticians on the same jbrowse environment. Upon research, I don't think such a feature exist?

Some additional info
- I'm running jbrowse/cli/1.4.4 (upgraded using `jbrowse upgrade`) inside a Docker container.
- I have 4 different gff files in my config.json file.
- Specifying a gff with the `--tracks` option results in the same error for each gff.
- My gff files have both Name and ID attributes in the gene rows.
- There is a symbolic link within the jbrowse folder that links a mounted data folder (containing all fna, gff, bam, wig, ... files), which has worked fine.

Any idea what triggers this error and how it might be fixed?

Thanks! Lennart"
2357,Make file chooser more configurable by internet accounts,closed,needs label triage,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-09-27T23:48:45Z,2021-10-07T00:18:03Z,2021-09-28T15:19:04Z,"This is a proposal for more adjustments to the file selector UI. I wanted to make the UI easier for the most common cases. I think that the large majority of users will have either no internet accounts configured (default for web) or Google Drive and Dropbox configured (possible future default for desktop). There does need to be some way to handle many configured accounts in the UI, but since that's an uncommon case, in this branch that particular UI does not show up until three or more accounts are configured. By default with two accounts configured, the UI looks like this (all four possible states):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/134997408-3d3199af-e049-4f12-b4af-0236283a046a.png)

With more accounts, there is a ""More"" button, and selecting an account from that menu moves it to be the last displayed account.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/134998797-1795e22f-f0e3-43e2-8ef0-6c3ff779f436.png)

In discussion earlier with @peterkxie and @carolinebridge-oicr, it came up that using text instead of icons might be more clear, but I think that because this is designed to be a compact UI, the ability to use icons makes it cleaner and easier for the user to understand. There are tooltips on the icons:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/134999220-a1ca4924-e5b8-4070-a989-4cbeefe1d60d.png)

The icons and the label text (e.g. ""Enter Dropbox share link"") are now optional parts of the account model, so each account can define them. It also allows internet accounts to provide their own component for selecting a location, so it could use something besides the URL input box. No accounts currently use this, but it allows for adding things like a custom file picker for some resource.

This PR also splits the file selector components up into multiple files since it was getting large.

Also missing is the ""Add account for authentication"" button. I think this will be necessary in the future, but not for the first release. Users can add an HTTP Basic account by entering the URL in the normal URL field, and the account will get added when the track tries to access the resource. We don't have a UI for configuring the other account types, so we can't add them in the track selector for now. I think once we have an internet account manager UI, there should be a button in the file selector that opens that UI where users can add or manage any type of account.

Also removes the external token account from the volvox config since it doesn't have a usable example."

- changed messaging for index file, to be more clear for the user what will happen
- spacing changes to the informational message when the user is on an internet account (i.e. the icon is centered now)
- condition for extra-long internet account names that they will be truncated if they exceed 12 characters (not in the dropdown menu, only on the ui display)
- added a label to the URL field, it really needs something there otherwise it looks completely empty, and I can see a user missing the field entirely
- moved the url field down below the grid containing the button group and add account button to make it consistent if the window is resized

**Here's what the UI would look like without term truncation:**

**IMO, the add account button looks weird attached to the button group and I wish it was justified to the end but I can't accomplish that if we want to maintain the use of Grid on this component. It is a minor visual thing, but I think we should consider using flex for this entire component if this is troublesome.**

- When you load the session, it gives you the dialog to pick a location and tracks
- When you type into the search box, it loads indexed features, as expected.
- if you type something, like 'tnf', it loads genes, as expected. I'll point out this is the first time this store loaded and you generally see a 'loading' text on the combo before results return.
- if you use the arrows and hit enter to pick a gene, it does not select it. The contents of the search box are unchanged.
- if you hit enter, nothing happens
- if you type again, at which point i assume the store backing this search is loaded, you can type 'tnf', use arrows to pick a gene and hit enter. only by this second time do the contents of the search box change, and hitting enter will navigate to the gene of interest."

I tried adding a variety of flags, like `--dryrun` and `--target .` and `--target ./config.json` to no avail.

<!-- Put a clear and concise description of the bug here. -->

The  mostly cause of this problem is my config.json, which does work correctly for JBrowse 2, but may not be quite what this tool is expecting, as it's a combination of hand editing and automatically being generated from the jb1tojb2 script I'm working on.  I've attached that config at the top of this issue (with the extension changed to txt so I could upload it).  If it helps, this JBrowse 2 is running on a machine at http://18.206.115.254/ however, that may go away at some point.

Another potential point of failure is that the data files are remote; if that's not supported, the documentation should state that explicitly.

I have a jbrowse 2 session where my config contains a GFF track. This track was indexed standalone using ""jbrowse text-search --file xxxx.gff"". When I type into the search box i get the expected typeahead. When I pick a feature and the dialog pops up, i get:

The results are valid, but is there a reason track is ""N/A""? I'm guessing maybe this has something to do with aggregate indexes (which need to be aware of track), and per-track indexes? The code must ""know"" the track for these results though?</div>"

2340,Workaround for Google Drive not exposing Content-Range,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-09-18T03:41:22Z,2021-09-22T03:36:00Z,2021-09-20T18:09:38Z,"I was able to load a BigWig from Google Drive just fine, but CRAM didn't work. This ended up being because Google Drive doesn't expose the Content-Range header, so whenever the filehandle called `stat` (which it does on CRAM but not BigWig), it errored out.

This workaround provides a custom `openLocation` for Google Drive accounts that uses a custom filehandle that overrides the `stat` method. This `stat` gets the file size by getting the file metadata from the Google Drive API, since it can't get the size from the Content-Range header.

It also switches to using a different endpoint for the file contents so that v3 of the Google Drive API is used instead of v2. @peterkxie this will probably need to be fixed to restore `fetchFile` like you fixed my Dropbox code in 36ab6f59b578b63fb538d0d6c7cebd1a4f27631d.

This has been tested by logging in with the file owner's account and logging in with a different account when the file is shared and both scenarios work."
2337,`jbrowse upgrade` does not clean up old worker files,open,bug,,ilaydabozan,,,2021-09-16T13:24:13Z,2021-09-17T17:57:36Z,,"I don't know if this is expected behaviour, but when `jbrowse upgrade` is run, many copies of the following three files are produced, while the old set of many files remains with the different hashes.

```

worker.js.map 
```


**To Reproduce**

Run `jbrowse upgrade`

**Screenshots**

here is what the files are:

When following command is ran to remove the copies:
`rm *.ff8da6869c2040672276.*`
`npx serve .` command works as it's intended with the remaining files:

It can be confusing to have to scroll down the dropdown to find the exact match.

We can modify the ranking of options that match the option label or display string, so that the manager knows how to sort them. 

e.g  searching for Notch in autocomplete (hg19 example)

Notch1 should be displayed towards the top of the dropdown list vs the options that were matched due to its description.

2330,Don't sort sequences in FromConfigSequenceAdapter,closed,needs label triage,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-09-14T23:51:30Z,2021-09-15T22:39:50Z,2021-09-15T22:39:47Z,A user using the FromConfigSequenceAdapter and the React Circular Genome View noted that it was unexpected that the regions around the circle were not in the same order specified in the adapter config. I agree that this seems unexpected and propose that we don't sort and instead keep the sequences in the same order they are specified.

- Make renderProps not a getter to match recent changes"
2328,Use ../ for all doc links and use trailing slash to fix links,closed,"bug,documentation",,cmdcolin,,,2021-09-14T15:52:21Z,2021-09-15T18:17:03Z,2021-09-15T17:51:45Z,"Currently I found there are links that can end up broken if you click through the docs

Especially if you follow a link someone gives you e.g. https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_cli#indexing-feature-names-for-searching

And then you go on to click the link to the CLI docs

This fails with a 404

There is a subtle behavior where the browser or server automatically adds a slash


So if you copy and paste https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_cli into the browser, then it becomes
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_cli/
and then navigating to
./cli
is
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_cli/cli
when it should be
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/cli

However it is subtle also because currently, clicking on
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/
Then clicking quickstart_cli, gives you
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_cli 
No slash is added


This PR takes an approach that is kind of weird

It turns on a setting for trailingSlash, so that a trailingSlash is always added

Then it makes all docs use ../ to refer to each other

This is not a great outcome for doc usability, it is just unclear why the ../ is needed. We could also use absolute paths with / if interested

However, this would fix our issues on the website

I created https://github.com/cmdcolin/docusaurus-nav-issue/blob/master/README.md to demo the issue in docusaurus and a follow up here https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide/pull/6#issuecomment-919263203"

2299,Add new pluggable element type and properties to adapter type for registering adapter association with 'add track' workflow,open,enhancement,,carolinebridge-oicr,carolinebridge-oicr,carolinebridge-oicr,2021-09-07T18:53:55Z,2021-10-07T20:47:21Z,,"Resolves #2135 

These changes are dependent on #2279 merging into main first, as these changes synergize with the auth changes and are a part of that need/workflow.

Changes:

- adds a new pluggable element type `AdapterGuessType` that allows a plugin to register:
<t>1. a name coordinating with the adpater the guess is for
<t>2. a regex expression to guess the adapter given a string with a suffix
<t>3. a coordinating track type to suggest for the user given the adapter type
<t>4. a function to fetch the configuration for a given track with that adapter
- adds two new optional properties to `AdapterType`:
<t>1. `externalPluginName: string` which allows an adapter type to identify its external plugin name to sort it with a header in the adapter selector dropdown menu in the Add Track workflow
<t>2. `excludeFromTrackSelector: boolean` which allows an adapter type to identify if it would like to be excluded from the adapter selector dropdown menu in the Add Track workflow (e.g. `SNPCoverageAdapter`)
- adds code infrastructure to eliminate adapters with the `excludeFromTrackSelector: true` property from the UI
- adds code infrastructure to add headers over a set of given plugin adapters if they share the `externalPluginName` property within the Adapter Selector dropdown menu

Example:

If I have a new Adapter for my plugin, I might register it as,

```js
    pluginManager.addAdapterType(
      () =>
        new AdapterType({
          name: 'MafAdapter',
          configSchema: mafConfigSchema,
          AdapterClass: MafAdapter,
          externalPluginName: 'GDC Plugin Adapters',
        }),
    )
    pluginManager.registerAdapterGuess(
      () =>
        new AdapterGuessType({
          name: 'MafAdapter',
          regexGuess: /\.maf$/i,
          trackGuess: 'VariantTrack',
          fetchConfig: (file: FileLocation) => {
            return {
              type: 'MafAdapter',
              mafLocation: file,
            }
          },
        }),
    )
```

which will register my adapter and my adapter's associated guess properties for the Add Track workflow. In the above example, my adapter will appear under a header in the Adapter Selector dropdown that reads ""GDC Plugin Adapters"". The adapter will also be able to be guessed via its provided regexGuess if given a file directive that ends with `.maf` and return the proper configuration by running the file provided through the Add Track workflow to its configured `fetchConfig` function."

2294,Don't rely on SVTYPE=BND for breakend split view options and thicker mouseover chords on circular views,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-09-06T07:29:21Z,2021-09-06T22:04:20Z,2021-09-06T22:03:54Z,"This PR works in tandem with a major version bump to @gmod/vcf
https://github.com/GMOD/vcf-js/pull/69

The reason I found this is because there were breakends in the COLO829 dataset (on config_demo.json, hg19) that I wanted to check out. They are actually representing an SVTYPE=DEL using breakend representation, and it was not possible to do breakend split view on this example.

To fix, my strategy was to have basically ""point-of-use"" breakend parsing: most usages of the breakends should know when they need it parsed out, and can do so at that point by importing parseBreakend from @gmod/vcf


Also, some notable other things:


FromConfigAdapter does not need to have logic for parsing out mate/bnd/chr2, it does not respond to getFeatures requests with data about those mates, and ref renaming for those entities actually has to be done on the client side (see https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/1911#issuecomment-821243233)

2293,Use a less greedy file watcher for lower dev CPU usage,closed,internal,,cmdcolin,,,2021-09-05T18:41:17Z,2021-09-07T14:07:50Z,2021-09-06T18:05:35Z,"This proposes using a less greedy file watcher for our default yarn start setup

It also removes the max header size because we now use session sharing rather than huge url sizes

The less greedy file watcher helps reduce CPU usage considerably from ~6% CPU (what i see pretty much constantly while `yarn start` is idling, similar to the ~7% reported in the issue) to nothing (in issue it is reported as ~0.2%)

2289,Update trix to return the matched search term if it is not part of the label,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2021-09-03T18:28:08Z,2021-09-15T22:40:53Z,2021-09-15T22:40:45Z,"This proposes an update to trix to take advantage of https://github.com/GMOD/trix-js/pull/8

And then the search manager changes it to display a ""displayString"" by default. The displayString is the label, unless the trix search term is not in the label, in which case it is the label + ' ('+trix search term+')'

This is because label is used for re-performing the search in exact mode on the user hitting enter, so I do not want to re-perform the search as ""EDEN (kinase)""

2288,Add extra re-exports for default modules,open,needs label triage,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-09-03T18:12:37Z,2021-09-15T18:04:15Z,,"There are some inconsistencies in the way things are re-exported from core. For example, most of the pluggable element types look something like this:

```js
import TrackType from '../pluggableElementTypes/TrackType'
const libs = { '@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/TrackType': TrackType, /* ...all the other libs */ }
```

But the render type looks like this:

```js
import * as RendererType from '../pluggableElementTypes/renderers/RendererType'
const libs = { '@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/renderers/RendererType': RendererType, /* ...all the other libs */ }
```

Most of the renderers are like that, but the chord renderer is different:

https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/blob/67a19b3d04f72f576ddbbf4f48ca67cb29965b3d/packages/core/ReExports/modules.ts#L63-L67

This has some implications for how these are used at runtime. To properly get the TrackType at runtime, you have to do:

```js
const TrackType = JBrowseExports['@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/TrackType']
```

But for RendererType you have to add a `.default`

```js
const RendererType = JBrowseExports['@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/renderers/RendererType'].default
```

The real problem gets to be when a build system is trying to compile a plugin. These two imports looks similar:

```
import TrackType from '@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/TrackType'
import RendererType from '@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/renderers/RendererType'
```

but have to get compiled differently to use the global JBrowseExports properly. Our current UMD plugin build does some things to try to smooth this out, which work most of the time, but building to other targets doesn't work as well. Also, if core were ever used directly as a module running in Node, you'd have to worry about putting `.default`s in the right places as well.

The change in this PR doesn't change any of this behavior, since I didn't want to break anything, but it does add some exports for the renderers so there is a consistent and named (not default) way of importing them that build systems can understand more easily."
2287,Use react-popper to reduce tooltip lag on pages with many elements,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-09-03T15:36:29Z,2021-09-06T23:01:54Z,2021-09-06T22:59:47Z,"This uses react-popper library manually to create a tooltip

It is a second approach to  https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/2284

The calculation of the width of the tooltip is done manually with getBoundingClientRect. It doesn't appear to perfectly track the coordinates of where you want to display it

I think that overcoming the limitations in #2284 will be good, and while it takes a fair amount more code to do it this way, it helps greatly with the users perceived speed on the page.

I think it is either this or we get rid of some tooltips by default

For example, I just recently realized the `util/range` utils were not re-exported. Anything that's not re-exported can't be used by plugins.

It would be a pretty breaking change, but I'd like to at least explore the possibility of re-organizing core to be easier to use and maintain. Specifically I'd like to explore:
- Is the sub-package importing (e.g. everything is imported from `@jbrowse/core/<something>` actually helping with code splitting? If we could export everything at the top level, it would make the re-exports much easier to maintain
- Could we split core up into multiple packages? Specifically I think ""core"" for things that plugins use and ""app-core"" for things that probably only jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop would use could be good. Maybe a third ""ui"" package for various React components as well."

2277,New text-index command is not showing results in search box,closed,bug,,duncancarroll,,,2021-08-31T21:25:26Z,2021-09-08T16:28:49Z,2021-09-08T16:28:49Z,"Hi folks! 👋

First off, thanks for the great components & tools!

My issue is, I have a Jbrowse 1.3.5 React component running [here](https://smm-data.herokuapp.com/dna) which shows a GRCh37 assembly with a Variant Track of my SNPs originally from 23AndMe.  It seems to work great, however I've run into problems trying to make it searchable.

For some reason I couldn't find  `jbrowse text-index` as a command in 1.3.5 (this seemed strange since I thought it was an existing feature), so I pulled latest `main` and built the CLI.  I was then able to run `jbrowse text-index` which produced the various trix files, about 50Mb which seems to list all my variants by `rs________` Reference SNP.  I pushed these to S3 where they are [world-readable](https://bucketeer-b2ec4285-3f6c-49c8-9753-fe99a1df2ac6.s3.amazonaws.com/public/raw/dna/trix/GRCh37.ix) and added them into my config file per the [instructions](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/config_guide#text-searching).

The component compiles fine, however nothing seems to show up in the search box.  It's possible I'm misunderstanding something but I was expecting to be able to type in something like `rs4747667` and jump to that variant's location.  Is it possible the new text-index isn't backwards-compat with 1.3.5?  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!

**To Reproduce**
A copy of the config file I'm using is [here](https://bucketeer-b2ec4285-3f6c-49c8-9753-fe99a1df2ac6.s3.amazonaws.com/public/raw/dna/config.json) which contains public URLs to all relevant files.  This is passed to a React component via the normal means:
```
const textSearchConfig = {
    assembly,
    aggregateTextSearchAdapters,
    tracks,
    defaultSession,
    location
  }

    const state = createViewState(textSearchConfig);
    return <JBrowseLinearGenomeView viewState={state} />;
```
**Expected behavior**
Entering a Reference SNP code e.g. `rs4747667` would jump to that location.

**Version:**
1.3.5 of React component with latest `main` of JBrowse2 CLI tools.

Anyways, there is a maxWidth:500, minWidth:200 (uses custom width calculation instead of directly using minWidth/maxWidth  in css, didn't seem like it works in css to sensibly autoadjust by specifying those see https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-j2c1b?file=/demo.js seems to expand to maxWidth by default)

Instead of using copy-to-clipboard package, this use the native clipboard API to make the copy to clipboard.
If not available, it will fall back to the deprecated execCommand API.

While this fix the issue, it loses the ability to copy a sequence with color.
So at the request of @cmdcolin  I have also added a `Copy HTML` button. It still uses copy-to-clipboard for this, as the clipboard API is too recent to be used with HTML (usage with HTML is experimental with Firefox and was added to Chrome less than a year ago) and I wasn't able to make it work with execCommand.

**Describe the bug**

Hi,
I've recently stumble on the fact that the copy button for sequence (CDS, protein, etc) in feature details>Subfeature>Transcript doesn't work. 

I've encountered this issue first in @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view, but this seems to be also present in the [demo](https://jbrowse.org/code/jb2/v1.3.5/).



**To Reproduce**

1. Go to the [demo](https://jbrowse.org/code/jb2/v1.3.5/) 
2. Open a linear genome view
3. Open a chromosome
4. Add `Gencode v19` tracks
5. Click on a gene
6. Try to copy a transcript sequence

**Expected behavior**

Should copy correctly

**Screenshots**

I'm speaking about the copy button next to CDS and above the DNA sequence.

Technically we could try to make both work in such a way that the feature is not available in the chrom sizes case but this may be a little easier

Force loading can be useful in some situations, but often will crash the page. Also, crashes can occur even when zoomed in past the cutoff if there is a lot of dense data (e.g. a very deep alignments track).

@elliothershberg and I were brainstorming possible ways to mitigate some of this. One idea we had was to have the range fetcher inspect the ranges that are being requested and preemptively error out the request if it is requesting a very large amount of data. This could be determined from range size, or if requesting the whole file from the file size. This wouldn't work if something requests a lot of data in the form of many small chunks, but would at least give us some opportunity to intercept requests that will likely crash the page.

Benchmarking of request sizes that currently crash the page is needed to know if this is practical."

2247,New jbrowse-desktop start screen design ,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-08-23T20:35:29Z,2021-09-02T21:26:20Z,2021-09-02T21:17:55Z,"This is a proposal for the jbrowse desktop start screen redesign
- It includes a predefined datasets e.g. hg19 and hg38 on the start screen that user can easily launch. This is a simple preconfigured config.json for those assemblies
- Config+session are wrapped up into single file on desktop (e.g. session is dynamically put into defaultSession on a config, and the ""sessions"" are full configs that are serialized into the userdata e.g. ~/.config/@jbrowse/desktop/sessions)
- Ability to open e.g. the pre-existing config.json's made for web locally on desktop (e.g. open the volvox config.json, it converts uri into localPaths on loading to make this work, and also it does not write over this config.json, but instead just reads it and writes data to the ~/.config/@jbrowse/desktop/sessions directory. this is less of a decision that was made and more of a ""it just worked out"" to do it like that, but could try to change if needed)
- Ability to open a new assembly directly from the start screen similar to the ""Assembly manager"" form
- Refactors loader on desktop so that it does not load any initial config or pluginmanager. This could be somewhat be reconsidered but I think it helps to think of it this way because there helps especially with achieving goals around toggling between entire config.jsons at the start screen.
- Converts electron.js into electron.ts to get a little type safety assurance, and updates some of the ""session"" concepts to deal with configs instead

Note for view launcher: Currently disappears if view.length>0 but we could instead have the view launcher available too

Note also: this was sort of a blazing-the-trail type thing, and uncovered interesting technical hurdles like merging the session and config together into one file. I am open to design updates too for this but I think this PR does manage to take care of a number of issues that have come up during UI review

**Describe the bug**

Hi,
I have tried to upgrade to Jbrowse 1.3.3, but since this update, I can't build my Next.js project, as I got the following error:

In dev mode:

```bash
./node_modules/@jbrowse/core/util/io/LocalFile.js:42:0

2243,Import bookmarks functionality for grid bookmark widget,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-08-21T06:45:35Z,2021-08-25T01:13:44Z,2021-08-25T01:09:35Z,"I had a quick interest in getting a import bookmarks function implemented

This let's a user quickly import a BED formatted file. The name column 4 is stored in the ""label"" field

It also has a couple more add-ons

* replaces the NA default export with a . which is the standard not available data description for BED
* makes it so duplicates in bookmarks are allowed, as this may come from data files, and rather than filtering on import, it retains them (note that if this was not done, then strange errors would occur on editing fields)
* makes the hover style on links in the grid bookmark widget cursor:pointer

Some motivation to this includes my feeling that you can easily loose track of your session 

During development especially, I cycle through tons of sessions and I imagine a user may also, and if we're not careful, we would loose our bookmarks (since bookmarks are currently tied to session...). So if we can at least re-import them, it seems useful

(a) a defaultSession loads a view who has a displayedRegion assembly that fails e.g. 404
(b) browsing the import form and selecting an assembly gives an error e.g. 404

See #2235 

The volvox demo data has a ""volvox404"" assembly added that is always a 404. To test, you can also generate other errors by turning off network in chrome or inserting a throw into the sequence adapter's getRegions function or similar.

This results in a couple places where we have to be careful to clear the error state. There is the view model's error state, and there is the import form components error state. The import form components error state is initialized with the model's error state, and import form onSubmit clears the model's error state

This is also for the LGV only, and if we want to put it into other parts of the app, we may need to perform more effort, or create some better abstractions.

The reason for the external sort change is there are hard limits with the in memory data structures we attempted to use, specifically that more than 8.3M records in a Object (e.g. {}) that causes 100% cpu and 16.7M records in a Map which is a known chrome limit https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=11852

There are some packages that try to work around this, but it will put a lot of pressure on nodejs heap, so instead of pushing the limits of in-memory sort, this changes to a disk-based external sort

With this change, 37M records from dbSNP (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/VCF/00-common_all.vcf.gz from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/human_variation_vcf/) can be indexed in 40minutes on my machine with 16GB memory, though it never exceeds any large amount of memory consumption

In JBrowse 1, an option for XYPlot tracks was `fixBounds` which, if set to false, would display the max and min scores specified in the configuration exactly as given and not rounded to a ""prettier"" number. I used this to display peaks that appear at or above 2 standard deviations above the data set mean, as a crude method of peak calling.

The collapsed category state was not stored in the widget model properly, and it was causing the code to forget the collapsed categories after a track is toggled (which causes the tree to get rerendered)

Note: Technically it might be somewhat expensive/not the best way to do things for for the tree to get recalculated after things like a track toggle or category collapse, but it seems to work fine afaik

This proposes using an ""unassuming"" BED parser that will use the strand/score fields if it makes sense to, otherwise it just stores the fieldnames, and only tries to use @gmod/bed if the code is actually a BED12 file or has autoSql attached

With this change added, the BED tabix files in #2198 display properly e.g. just as boxes indicating the region of the inversion, and some fields that don't have any description are called field5,field6,field7... in the feature details panel

2198,Add better inversion visualization to read vs reference visualizations,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-08-09T09:54:20Z,2021-08-10T12:36:04Z,2021-08-10T12:35:59Z,"In the past PR #2024 the strand got ignored in read vs ref because after drawing negative strand alignments was added to the renderer, it was realized that strand was not specified correctly at that time of loading the data for read vs ref visualizations

This change makes the read vs reference strand become relative to the ""original strand"" the feature was on.

Intuitively if a read is on the forward strand, switches to the reverse, and back to forward

```
----->   <------ ----->
```

And the left most is the ""primary"" alignment (the rest are supplementary/split read alignments) then the strands are 1 for primary, -1 and then 1 for supp

But also the data can come in like


```
<------ -------> <------
```

This is fundamentally equivalent but the data is just from a reverse strand template. Therefore we flip the read orientation relative to the original strand when we plot it

Example showing inversion
![localhost_3000__config=test_data%2Fconfig_demo json session=local-6er93LMsa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6511937/128688622-fa973fe6-38b9-4918-8a87-ee4badd0aff9.png)


In this case the supplementary alignments do not store their cigar strings in the SA tag, so they are not plotted, but the data should otherwise be accurate. The overhand of the inverted polygon with the left side is also I believe expected. We can look at the SA tag and see that it says 5002 bases soft clipped for the inverted part, and this directly corresponds to it starting at position 5002 on the bottom panel (since the bottom panel is the literal sequence, it is just starting at position 5002 because thats how many bases are clipped off)

2176,Text searching streamline 2,closed,"needs label triage,text searching",,cmdcolin,,,2021-07-30T06:48:55Z,2021-08-06T18:57:05Z,2021-08-06T18:56:54Z,"This is a proposal to use a modified stream-based approach for text indexing

Using this approach, we can go from 20+min (hard to tell, errored out) on gencode gff to 30s 

This performs several simplifications. We could consider whether this meets all the requirements after applying those simplifications, but I think it can be workable


1. No use of @gmod/gff- Instead it loops through the GFF line by line with no reconstruction of feature hierarchy
1. Indexes all types that have a Name/ID except CDS/exon (could add extra userfilterable include/exclude filters)
1. Adds configurable --attributes command line flag so that user can choose what attributes to index
1. Does not do description parsing of Note field in GFF by default now, it could be optionally added but jbrowse 1 did not do it by default and i think it may be better to make it a user-supplied option (note that the gencode still errored out even if Note/description were not used)
1. Removes usage of meta.json
1. Accepts a --force flag to overwrite a previous index
1. Uses simply the assembly name as the textAdapterId. This is a little different from the hash-based implementation currently on text_searching branch. My feeling is that we should encourage one aggregateSearchIndex per assembly, and more than that may be, perhaps, per-track adapters. At least as a general guideline. Therefore, instead of allowing them to create a new aggregate search index adapter just with a new set of tracks, we check just for whether a particular assembly has already been indexed and logs a message if so (unless --force is supplied, it won't try to re-index it or overwrite it)
1. Removes usage of createFilterOptions. The default usage of createFilterOptions actually removes returned results that have no overlap with the search string that we entered, however, this currently can happen in this branch. While we can think about this, I think the easiest thing to do is use our own filtering criteria. For example, searching ""kinase"" returns EDEN, m10, m12, m14 but just their names, not the string kinase. Since it doesn't return the string with any substring containing kinase, it filters them out. Ideally we would say (a) what gene ID/gene Name the search result hit and (b) why, e.g. that it hit in the description of that gene ID. I'm a little concerned this will bloat search index size but we could add a fifth field to our results e.g. the context in which it was found in a feature


Just for context format for the trix input looks like a list like this 

```
/* for each feature */
base64([locstring,trackId,name,id]) ....terms to associate with the base 64 string e.g. the name and id
base64([locstring,trackId,name,id]) ....terms to associate with the base 64 string e.g. the name and id
base64([locstring,trackId,name,id]) ....terms to associate with the base 64 string e.g. the name and id
```

and then the output in the ix file, e.g. the sorted terms to associate all mapped to that base64 string

```
64 base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
and base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
associate base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
base base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
e.g. base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
id base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
name base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
string base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
terms base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
the base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])
to base64([locstring,trackId,name,id])

2175,Updates to bookmark widget,closed,needs label triage,,cmdcolin,,,2021-07-29T23:35:19Z,2021-07-30T19:57:30Z,2021-07-30T19:57:27Z,"These are a couple proposals for the bookmark widget


1) Uses a method for ""auto-calculating"" the width of a particular column that is used in the base feature details
2) Makes it so DeleteBookmark is just a dialog and not also a button. If it is a Button with a Dialog state inside it, it will render that dialog many times, even if in a hidden state. I propose extracting the Dialog as such
3) Makes a compact mode. I personally prefer the look of compact data displays, but could understand if this is not what all users want. I add it as an option here
4) Adds a note that lets users know that they can edit the label field by double clicking


Main thing I wanted to do this PR is (1)

The reason is we presupply a pixel width for each column. DataGrid does not have a method to change column widths. It would probably be ideal to have that, but even still, auto-calculating the width of a column is somewhat nice

2168,Fix mouseover after force load,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2021-07-28T23:14:55Z,2021-07-29T02:37:21Z,2021-07-29T02:08:34Z,"Fixes #2130 

This is a surprise where I thought the layout data structure was causing issues and resulted in some layout code restructuring (converting to rbush)

I still think converting to rbush was a good change, but the proximal issue for #2130 is that the code for getting the feature calls

```
       getFeatureOverlapping(blockKey: string, x: number, y: number) {
+        console.log(self.blockState.get(blockKey), blockKey, [
+          ...self.blockState.keys(),
+        ])
         return self.blockState.get(blockKey)?.layout?.getByCoord(x, y)
       },
```

We could even consider this to be a little too low level for BaseLinearDisplay but when you console.log this the blockKey that is received has -reload appended, an earlier way we used to force a rerender, while the blockKeys in self.blockState.keys() do not have the -reload appended. I did not fully map why that is the case, but this PR provides an alternative way to force a re-render where it has a reload tag on the block state, and fixes the issue

Instead of having a plain-js wrapper around the React LGV as a separate package, this adds a UMD build of the React LGV that can then be used in plain-js use cases. This way, we don't have another package to maintain and publish. It takes a bit more code on the user's part, but I think it actually makes it more clear to the user what is going on. Here's a comparison of what a very simple example would be like with the wrapper package and the UMD build of the component.

### Wrapper package

```html
<html>

<head>
  <script src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse.org/jb2_releases/jbrowse-linear-genome-view/jbrowse-linear-genome-view%40v1.3.2/umd/jbrowse-linear-genome-view.js""></script>
</head>

<body>
  <div id=""jb2_lgv""></div>

    const genomeView = new JBrowseLinearGenomeView({
      container: document.getElementById('jb2_lgv'),
      assembly: {/* assembly info */ },
      tracks: [/* tracks */],
      plugins: [],
      defaultSession: {/* session info */ },
      location: 'ctgA:1105..1221',
    })
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

### Use React component UMD directly

<body>
  <div id=""jb2_lgv""></div>
  <script>
    const {
      createViewState,
      JBrowseLinearGenomeView,
    } = JBrowseReactLinearGenomeView
    const { createElement } = React
    const { render } = ReactDOM

    const state = createViewState({
      assembly: {/* assembly info */ },
      tracks: [/* tracks */],
      plugins: [],
      defaultSession: {/* session info */ },
      location: 'ctgA:1105..1221',
    })

    const container = document.getElementById('jb2_lgv')
    render(
      createElement(JBrowseLinearGenomeView, { viewState: state }),
      container,
    )
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

Using the React component UMD build also allows users to add other React componets around it in the style of [this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute).

Since people seem to still be using the embedding tutorial, if we make this change we will need to do a new, updated tutorial or some other kind of guide.

It also changes the name of the package.json script from `build-storybok` to `build:storybook`. The reason is that the executable is called `build-storybook`, and it's good to avoid having the script name be the same as the executable name. This is because if you want to call the executable with different args than are in the script (e.g. calling it without `--quiet`), you can no longer use `yarn build-storybook` to do that because that calls the script instead of the executable."

2144,Proof of concept for jb1tojb2 CLI tool,open,needs label triage,,cmdcolin,,,2021-07-20T22:05:13Z,2021-09-20T23:52:28Z,,"This makes a best effort conversion of jbrowse 1 trackList.json to jbrowse 2 config.json

Uses same logic to the jbrowse 1 connection code

It also currently copies this over rather than link to it even from @jbrowse/core, but we could reconsider that and make it depend on core perhaps. There is a long history of tiny packages in js so we could think about this in terms of breaking up core in our monorepo into smaller packages perhaps

2142,Plugin Documentation Refresh,open,documentation,,garrettjstevens,,,2021-07-20T19:26:52Z,2021-07-21T18:44:01Z,,"Along with plugin updates (#2046, #2114, or similar), we need to refresh our plugin documentation to help users be able to easily create JBrowse plugins. We need to document examples of the following types of plugin development workflows:

- Simple no-build plugin that is just a single file that does something like add or alter menu items, etc.
- Plugin using the `jbrowse-plugin-template` build system that does more complex things like use TypeScript, bundle in a dependency, etc. This plugin might e.g. add a new display type.
- Plugin using the `jbrowse-plugin-template` build system that does desktop-specific actions like running a CLI tool, parsing the results, and displaying them in JBrowse.

For future discussion: how to arrange these different workflow docs on our website."
2141,Update to @material-ui/core@4.12.2,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-07-20T10:43:17Z,2021-07-21T17:30:08Z,2021-07-21T17:30:06Z,"
This PR updates to @material-ui/core, lab, and data-grid, presumably getting bugfixes and improvements. I was actually interested in this though because I used jb2export and it printed the message
```
$ jb2export --fasta ~/src/gmod/jbrowse/docs/tutorial/data_files/volvox.fa --configtracks refseq --loc ctgA:1-100

Material-UI: the createMuiTheme function was renamed to createTheme.

You should use `import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles'`
```

This is somewhat interesting just because it shows we are getting an updated @material-ui/core when installing it with `npm install -g @jbrowse/img`. That makes sense because we don't necessarily pin versions



I tried updating to the latest @material-ui/core just to make sure that generally things work, in case this affects things like @jbrowse/linear-genome-view.

- Refactored the bookmark code out of the `data-management` plugin into a separate new core plugin
- Moved all bookmark state into the model for the bookmark widget (this state still persists throughout session)
- @garrettjstevens implemented an extension system (closes #2032 )
- Refactored the rubberband code in order to make the menu extensible
- Moved the bookmark code updating the LGV model out of the LGV plugin and into this plugin using the new extension system

2139,"admin-server does not respect ""config"" URL parameter",closed,bug,,garrettjstevens,,,2021-07-19T22:10:58Z,2021-09-22T21:36:49Z,2021-09-22T21:36:49Z,"**Describe the bug**

If you use the `config` URL param to open up a different config from the default `./config.json`, it updates the default config, not the config specified in the URL param.

**To Reproduce**

1.
```
jbrowse create jbrowse2
cd jbrowse2/
jbrowse admin-server
```
2. Open the URL that admin-server provides, but add a config location, e.g. `http://localhost:9090/?adminKey=1ed63244e1&config=test_data_volvox_config.json`
3. Edit the config (e.g. add/remove a track)
4. Instead of `./test_data/volvox/config.json` getting updated, `./config.json` gets overwritten with the new volvox config, losing any configuration that was already in that file. The config file might not be valid, either, as it may depend on relative file URLs that are not valid in that location.

**Expected behavior**

The config specified in the URL should be updated, not the default one

**Version:**

2138,Using admin-server to open local files makes config unusable outside admin mode,closed,bug,,garrettjstevens,,,2021-07-19T21:58:26Z,2021-08-03T14:08:36Z,2021-08-03T14:08:36Z,"**Describe the bug**

Discovered by @junjun-zhang [here](https://gitter.im/GMOD/jbrowse?at=60f5ed897b5a415e65f582ec).

If you open an assembly from a local file while using admin-server, it saves that local file configuration to the config. If that config file is then opened in non-admin mode, the user can't edit the config to re-open the file (and in principle might not even have the same file on their system).

**To Reproduce**

1. Open admin-server in new JBrowse Web installation
2. Add an assembly and use a local file
3. Close admin-server and open the app with a normal server (e.g. `serve .`)
4. Try to open a linear genome view

**Expected behavior**

I think the expected behavior is that you shouldn't be allowed to add local file configs from the GUI in admin-server mode. I can't think of a situation where a server admin adding a local file config would be useful.

**Screenshots**

![](https://files.gitter.im/5a678a1ed73408ce4f89c620/kKTK/image.png)

**Version:**

1.3.2

**Additional context**

This also affects tracks as well as assemblies from local files.

This does a couple things

1) Removes --location. The output of the data should always be the --out directory
2) Makes the text-index command index files with the outDir as the 'baseUri' so that when I use `jbrowse text-index --out ../../test_data/volvox/` then it knows the gff3 files that it is looking for are in `../../test_data/volvox/`
3) Removes --individual, we could reconsider this but I think we are not yet equipped to figure out per-track indexing
4) Changes code to use ixixx-js so we no longer depend on C binary for ixIxx https://github.com/cmdcolin/ixixx-js
5) Removes the multiple instances of aggregate indexers from volvox config, just uses trix
6) Various refactoring to try to streamline the code paths for the streams
7) Automatically output the aggregateTextSearchAdapters config with a TrixAdapter (very basic)
8) Removes the synthesizing a record for gff features that don't have any attributes to index
9) Removes indexing of feature type by default e.g. CDS

It is related to #2032, but is for the session model, instead of the state model on a display type. This was motivated by work on #2080 .

Here, before the session model is returned from the model factory, it checks if any plugins have an `extendSession` method defined. If it does, it updates the session model with the result of that function.

For example:

extendSession(sessionModel: IAnyModelType) {
  return types.compose(

Sometimes, for example if a user zooms out, they may want to just disable/collapse/turn off the track just temporarily while they get oriented

Closing a track can cause it to lose state (e.g. color by settings) that the user may have set on it, so ""collapsing it"" may be preferable

This moves the ""search"" icon to the beginning of the box and adds a ""help"" icon to the end of the box that has the tooltip. This way, since it's a large tooltip, it'll only show up if you hover over the help button, and otherwise it won't get in your way. The disadvantage to this approach is it takes up a bit more space it what is already sometimes a cramped text box. We could also consider making that box wider as part of this PR.

2086,Autocomplete search box usability,open,,,garrettjstevens,,,2021-06-29T23:31:44Z,2021-07-14T18:50:54Z,,"I've been trying out the autocomplete search box and have some observations and potential needed fixes. This could possibly be broken into separate issues, but I thought we could do that upon discussing them and making some decisions.

- If you click on the search box and there are more than 100 sequences, it shows ""more results..."", but if you start typing and then scroll to the bottom, even if there are more than 100 sequences that match what you typed so far, the ""more results..."" is missing.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/123878625-a9610c80-d8fc-11eb-8261-0ea6490274f5.png)
- If you type something that is both a sequence name and a text search match, sometimes it shows up under ""reference sequence,"" sometimes under ""text search results,"" but never under both. I haven't been able to figure out how to reliably reproduce when it shows up under one or the other, but I feel like it should show up under both categories.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/123878677-ceee1600-d8fc-11eb-836d-9606efbfbd77.png)

- The helper text ""Enter a sequence or locstring"" might be problematic. I think ""locString"" is a term we use internally, but isn't something a user should be expected to understand.

- Similarly, ""refName"" is also probably an internal term and not something users should have to know about.

I've also tried to think about how we could help users know what the search box can do. I thought we could have a more extensive description somehow. One idea I mocked up was having a box that describes what you can do pop up when you click on the search box:

2080,Implement grid bookmark widget,closed,enhancement,,elliothershberg,elliothershberg,elliothershberg,2021-06-28T18:07:45Z,2021-07-19T23:38:31Z,2021-07-19T23:38:27Z,"This PR implements a bookmark widget for the LGV using the [MUI Data Grid](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/) component. Closes #157

## Feature Overview

The main idea is to have a widget that can be used to store interesting regions in a view (this PR adds support for the LGV) that can be returned to later. The widget stores a table of the regions that have been bookmarked.

Currently what has been implemented:

- Option to open the widget from the view menu of the LGV
- Option to bookmark the current region from the view menu of the LGV
- Option to bookmark the selected region from the LGV rubberband menu
- BED or TSV export of the bookmark list from the widget
- Ability to remove individual bookmarks or to clear all bookmarks

Demo with the table displaying chrom, start, end, assembly, link (locstring), trash icon to delete

![2021-07-08 13-18-48 2021-07-08 13_22_53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19295181/124985747-a3031c80-dfef-11eb-9805-e9b9be7d407d.gif)

Screenshot of a more compact design with only the bookmark link and trash icon:

This comes with the advantage of not needing to resize the drawer widget 👍 

## Implementation details

- Currently, this PR extends the session model to contain an array of the bookmarks. Maybe, instead of adding new data to the session, the bookmarks could be kept somewhere else? (local storage, session storage, remote file) The difficulty I see with these alternatives is that you lose the observability of MobX/MST. Backing up a bit, the reason that the bookmarks need to be kept on the session is that widget state is lost when the widget is closed (the bookmarks would be wiped out).
- It also directly adds menu items in the LGV view and rubberband menu. We have talked about whether we want ""extension points"" (#2032 ) to enable plugins to add menu items to other plugins.
- This widget is currently a part of the `data-management` core plugin. It could potentially be put in its own plugin. (@cmdcolin has suggested the possibility of making that plugin external)

## Additional features

Here are some other things that haven't been implemented but could be:

- file import (probably starting with BED support)
- visual indicator that a region is bookmarked (I think this is hard to get right. If you adjust the view and it now differs even slightly, would no longer be one of the bookmarked regions, etc.)"
2079,Create integration test for read vs ref workflow,open,housekeeping,,cmdcolin,,,2021-06-25T15:24:54Z,2021-06-25T15:24:54Z,,"Just something that would be worth implementing as an integration test...just something that #2077 sort of brought up

Synteny workflows could also use this"
2078,Restore eslint rule for no-unused-vars,closed,internal,,cmdcolin,,,2021-06-25T14:57:58Z,2021-06-30T22:35:53Z,2021-06-30T22:35:48Z,The eslint rule for unused vars got disabled at some point. This re-enables it and fixes some of the related errors
2077,Reorient strands on read vs ref plots,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2021-06-24T19:03:21Z,2021-06-25T15:09:21Z,2021-06-25T15:09:18Z,"The fix from #2024 caused a knock-on effect of the read-vs-ref displays to display inversions where none existed. Reason being was that the read vs ref code assumed it should provide the strand of the read, but even though the strand of a given BAM read might be given as -1, all the data is actually oriented in the forward direction (e.g. the SEQ field will be read left to right aka 5' to 3' even for negative strand features)

Example: Current main displays inversions on a ""volvox SV"" example which should not be inversions (it is just a deletion)

2069,Provide users with extra docs on-plugin-install and make filters for plugin store,open,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-06-23T18:02:45Z,2021-06-23T18:03:19Z,,"The plugin store currently offers the ability to one-click install all plugins

* There may be some plugins that are not really usable on web if they are desktop specific
* There are also some plugins that may not really be usable in a one-click situation (requires config editing)
* There is also be some detailed procedure needed to find out how to use (e.g. navigating to specific menu to pop up a view)

It may be useful to add filters, so desktop plugins are not shown on web

It may also be useful to popup a little docs, or provide a link to the docs, after install

Metadata would be in the plugin store's plugins.json file

Example json attributes

desktop:true/false
web:true/false
pnp:false // ""plug and play"" e.g. can be used without hand editing config



example:non-admin filter settings on web
pnp:true
web:true

Therefore, a desktop-only plugin would have web:false and be filtered out

May need version range filtering

Extra: popup a doc location, which helps orient users once they install

docsLocation: ""http://mysite.com/plugindocs""

This is because `fetch('')` is a valid fetch that gets the current page. This adds some error throwing to `openLocation` if the uri (or localPath) is an empty string, so the error message would be at least a bit more sensible."

<p>A ReDos (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability
was responsibly disclosed to me via email by Colin on
Mar 5 2021 regarding an exponential time complexity for
linearly increasing input lengths for <code>hwb()</code> color strings.</p>
<p>Strings reaching more than 5000 characters would see several
milliseconds of processing time; strings reaching more than
50,000 characters began seeing 1500ms (1.5s) of processing time.</p>
<p>The cause was due to a the regular expression that parses
hwb() strings - specifically, the hue value - where
the integer portion of the hue value used a 0-or-more quantifier
shortly thereafter followed by a 1-or-more quantifier.</p>
<p>This caused excessive backtracking and a cartesian scan,
resulting in exponential time complexity given a linear
increase in input length.</p>
<p>Thank you Yeting Li and Colin Ife for bringing this to my
attention in a secure, responsible and professional manner.</p>
<p>A CVE will not be assigned for this vulnerability.

2065,Added ability to choose label justification for SvgFeatureRenderer.,closed,needs label triage,,tchannagiri,,,2021-06-22T11:25:21Z,2021-06-28T20:41:29Z,2021-06-28T20:41:04Z,"Hi JBrowse team,

I'm working on a project where there are many closely packed, sometimes overlapping features on the screen at once and so it is beneficial to have the feature labels centered to reduce the labels overlapping on the screen. I have added an option to the SvgFeatureRenderer to allow label to be justified left (default), center, right, start and end (start/end are the opposite of left/right when the view is horizontally flipped). I though maybe this feature would be useful to others using JBrowse so I'm opening this PR for it.

I have included the test config in the the jbrowse-web/public folder. All the options have been tested with different sized features, labels (including the case when labels must be truncated to fit), and when the view is horizontally flipped.

SceneGraph issue:
There appears to be an issue with the SceneGraph class in core/util/layouts. Namely, the nodes associate the left/top bounding box value of their children with their own left/top world space coordinates. This didn't seems to be causing issues previously because these coordinates were always 0 in the parent node. However, when large labels are added to a small feature with centered justification, for example, the child labels can extend the bounding box to have negative left coordinate. To make a long short short, when the absolute coordinates are computed the child's left corrdinate is added to the child twice: once by the child itself and once incorrectly by the parent beause it is using the child's left coordinate as it's own. I have currently hacked around this issue in SvgFeatureRenderer, but I can open a separate issue for it once I have confirmation that this is an actual problem and not my own misunderstanding.

Let me know if anything should be changed or fixed here to be considered for inclusion, or if I need to explain something more clearly. Thanks."

The second change was to export the offscreenCanvasPonyfill functions from `@jbrowse/core/util`.

1. A CORS rejection when attempting to load the app while also running a plugin
2. The requirement for custom headers to be sent as part of openURL (not just Authorization)

A ternary check for optional headers is performed before attempting to openUrl(), if authHeader and authToken are not defined, then this field will be undefined and avoid the CORS error being thrown when running the app with plugins.

A new field is added to the `UriLocation` model, `authHeader` which needs to be the header required to execute the authorization, this is a string.

For example, if you are creating the 'location' of a request to be made, your object might now look like
```js
{
  uri: metadata.downloadUrl,
  authHeader: 'Authorization',
  authToken: `Bearer ${oauthAccessTokenGoogle}`,

2058,Missing supercontig in the chromosome selector,closed,bug,,Akusem,teresam856,teresam856,2021-06-17T16:06:03Z,2021-06-25T15:02:44Z,2021-06-25T15:02:44Z,"
**Describe the bug**

Hi, 
Currently, I have, next to the chromosomes, mitochondrion, and chloroplast, only one supercontig accessible through the ""chromosome selector"" (see screenshot) in @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view.
While around 50 supercontigs are present in the reference Fasta, with the majority having genes on them, only `bd_32x35` is accessible. 

As I haven't see any bug report about such problem, I imagine it come from my Fasta and GFF files, but I wasn't able to determine the cause when comparing the data of the supercontig `bd_32x35` to the others supercontigs. 

Do you have any idea, of what could cause Jbrowse to not give access to a chromosome/contig ?

**To Reproduce**

The GFF and Fasta that I use are accessible [here](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/files/6671481/issue-github.tar.gz)

And my assembly/tracks/defaultSession config file look like that, with localhost:8000 being my data server:

Assembly:
```js

        },
      },
    },
  };
```

Tracks:

```js

          },
        },
        renderer: {
          type: ""SvgFeatureRenderer"",
        },
      },
    ],
  };
```
DefaultSession:
```js
{
  name: ""My session"",
  view: {
    id: ""linearGenomeView"",
    type: ""LinearGenomeView"",
    tracks: [
      {
        type: ""ReferenceSequenceTrack"",
        configuration: ""ASM15095v2-ReferenceSequenceTrack"",
        displays: [
          {
            type: ""LinearReferenceSequenceDisplay"",
            height: 140,
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        type: ""FeatureTrack"",
        configuration: ""ASM15095v2-genes"",

            height: 350,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
**Expected behavior**

Having access to all chromosomes/contigs present in the reference sequence

Hi Jbrowse devs,

**Description**

I have been using FromConfigAdapter to load data programmatically in JBrowse (config example below). However, when ‘subfeatures’ is specified for a feature in the FromConfigAdapter configuration, the FromConfigAdapter constructor goes into infinite recursion (or seems to at least). It appears that this is being caused by:

- 'new FromConfigAdapter(config)' calls 'new SimpleFeature(config)' on the config. This mutates the config if there are subfeatures (perhaps this is unintended). Because the subfeatures have handles to their parent this results in circular references in the original config object.
- When ‘new FromConfigAdapter(config)’ is called again with the same config object, it calls the superclass constructor, 'new BaseAdapter(config)', which calls 'idMaker(config)'. This goes into infinite regress because it keeps following the circular references in the config.

**To Reproduce**

1. Make sure 'volvox.2bit' from the test data is in the root directory for JBrowse Web.
2. Use this config.json:
```
{
  ""configuration"": {
    ""rpc"": {
      ""defaultDriver"": ""MainThreadRpcDriver""
    }

```
A new track ,'Track1', has been added containing a feature with two subfeatures.

3. Start JBrowse Web, create a linear genome view, and add  'Track1' from the track selector. It should hang at this point for a very long time.

**Expected behavior**

It should not hang.

**Version:**

Versions:

- JBrowse Linear React View 1.3.0
- JBrowse Web, current repository running with 'yarn start'.

OS: Ubuntu 20.04

Browser: Chrome Version 91.0.4472.77 (Official Build) (64-bit)

**Additional Context**

The bug appears to be in the SimpleFeature constructor. Here it stores a reference to the config:

```
if (isSimpleFeatureSerialized(args)) {
  this.data = args
} else {
  this.data = args.data || {}
  // load handle from args.parent (not args.data.parent)
  // this reason is because if args is an object, it likely isn't properly loaded with
  // parent as a Feature reference (probably a raw parent ID or something instead)
  this.parentHandle = args.parent
}
```
Then it mutates the subfeatures array:
```
const { subfeatures } = this.data
if (subfeatures) {
  for (let i = 0; i < subfeatures.length; i += 1) {
    if (typeof subfeatures[i].get !== 'function') {
      subfeatures[i].strand = subfeatures[i].strand || this.data.strand
      subfeatures[i] = new SimpleFeature({
        id: subfeatures[i].uniqueId || `${id}-${i}`,
        // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
        data: subfeatures[i] as Record<string, any>,
        parent: this,
      })
    }
  }
}
```

Also, to observe where the infinte recursion is happening it may be helpful to set a breakpoint in BaseAdaptert.ts:idMaker.

Hope this helps. Let me know if any other information is needed."

2047,Add missing BoxRendererType exports,closed,needs label triage,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-06-11T22:38:36Z,2021-06-14T18:40:18Z,2021-06-14T18:40:18Z,"Discussion https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/discussions/2042 helped me realize that we have some things missing in our re-exports in core. In this case, BoxRendererType was the default export in `packages/core/pluggableElementTypes/renderers/BoxRendererType.ts`, and in `packages/core/ReExports/modules.ts` it did:

```ts
// other imports...
import BoxRendererType from '../pluggableElementTypes/renderers/BoxRendererType'
// other imports...

const libs = {
  // other libs...
 '@jbrowse/core/pluggableElementTypes/renderers/BoxRendererType': BoxRendererType,
  // other libs
}

// other stuff
```

That meant that the named exports in BoxRendererType.ts didn't get added to `libs`. I don't think there's a way to add both named and default exports to a single entry in `libs`, so this PR changes BoxRendererType to a named export and then re-exports everything from that file.

There could be other things missing in the same way, though. I'm wondering if there's a way to be more methodical about our re-exports to make sure we don't miss things. Or, we could ban default exports in core (like with a [lint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-default-export.md)) to be sure this doesn't happen."

Some main points:

- With node integration, the same web worker bundle that is used in JBrowse Web works for desktop, too. So the ElectronRpcDriver and WindowWorker were removed, and the desktop app now uses web workers the same as the web app.
- `electron` can now be imported directly, it doesn't have to be accessed from `window`.
- Upgraded to the latest version of `electron`
- This PR doesn't use `LocalFile` from `generic-filehandle`, but once https://github.com/GMOD/generic-filehandle/pull/86 or similar is merged it can go back to using that."

When displaying the page, I see the following (JBrowse fails to render).

I have noticed that changing the ""type"" of the track to be ""BasicTrack"", JBrowse appears to render, but no repeats are visible. I've also noticed that changing the key ""type"" in track.js to be another random key, JBrowse again renders, and again without repeats.

**Expected behaviour**

I am expecting the repeats information for the sequence to be visible.

2034,configs.json to include a popup/mouseover/feature details content location,open,enhancement,,Tom-Shorter,,,2021-06-03T09:39:48Z,2021-06-04T09:42:47Z,,"A lot of users will want to know more information about what they are viewing, right now you have the popups/mouseover/feature details panel which are populated by the source file but is there the possibility that within the configs.json file we could specify the location of the contents of a mouseover/popup/feature details panel if not within the file (and of course, be totally optional).

Some of the tracks we will be using have 10M variants, each one being a row in a VCF and each row will contain information about the variant and where it can be found in other studies etc. Other tracks we plan on implementing (with the frequency distribution histograms) will need to be able to display a breakdown of the number of variants found within a region and from which study they come from, these tracks will be created dynamically via an API as an amalgamation of any number of individual tracks.

The mouseover/popup/feature details content size could become massive pretty quickly for some of our tracks and thus increase loading times drastically, if we could instead point to a URL where the content could be found then that would be ideal, not only would it reduce the size of the track files but it also saves me the hassle of rebuilding the track files whenever there is an update to ensure all of the track cross references are up to date as the URL would handle all of that dynamically.

I am a complete beginner with react, I can make a functioning website but that's about it so what I'm about to propose might not be possible. As JBrowse2 is react based I would propose that the URL serves a react component which is directly displayed on the browser without modification. This would put the browser owner in complete control of how the mouseover/popup/feature details panel looks without having to worry about updates to jbrowse modifying the look or behaviour. I'm not sure if this is something that react can do, it may be that an iframe to the endpoint would be the only way to ensure the styling remains the same between the URL and jbrowse and if that doesn't work well then the URL could just serve the content without the styling and then the styling would need to be handled by modifying the jbrowse components."

It could be an improvement to use some of the **platform specific** build targets supported by [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). After a bit of talking with @garrettjstevens and @cmdcolin , it seems like the following targets might make sense:

- MacOS: `dmg`
- Linux: `AppImage`
- Windows: `nsis`

Next, we are probably going to need some CI to do desktop builds, and possible to copy the builds to S3 like the web.

Finally, we need to figure out app signing for MacOS (#664), and Windows (#665)

I'm making this more general issue to track progress on this front.

This is because the theme has to be in the configuration so that it can be passed through in the RPC render, but the React LGV didn't have a slot for the theme in the configuration. The first commit in this PR adds that slot.

The problem then, though, is that users would have to put the theme both in the ThemeProvider and in the configuration for it to work. This PR proposes moving the ThemeProvider inside the ReactLGV, so that users no longer have to worry about it in their code. Theming will still be available, but via the configuration instead.

As an example:

Before
```js
const theme = {
  palette: {
    primary: { main: '#311b92' },
    bases: { A: { main: '#98FB98' } },
  },
}
function View() {
  const state = createViewState({
    assembly: { /* assembly */ },
    tracks: [ /* tracks */ ],
    configuration: { theme }
  })
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={createJBrowseTheme(theme)}>
      <JBrowseLinearGenomeView viewState={state} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

After
```js
const theme = {
  palette: {
    primary: { main: '#311b92' },
    bases: { A: { main: '#98FB98' } },
  },
}
function View() {

Some pros and cons about the service worker are here: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/. If we decide to keep using it, you should be able to create a sample app with a working service worker to compare to by running e.g.

2006,Allow Custom Tracks/Data Adapters from Plugins to Add Config Options to Track Menu Items,closed,enhancement,,jjrozewicki,,,2021-05-24T04:27:59Z,2021-08-25T14:19:14Z,2021-08-25T14:19:14Z,"I apologize for the length of this. I have been working on this issue for many weeks, and I have finally been able to describe clearly the problem I'm having. There is a bug in the sense that it seems like JBrowse2 works differently than described in the documentation, but I'm also requesting a more substantial fix than just fixing that specific problem as I do not think it will fix the key issue.

**Background**

I am currently maintaining a simple plugin that calculates custom statistics from the reference sequence information and displays it as a QuantitativeTrack. It is implemented as a DataAdapter. It works well. My users are able to have GC content and a whole host of other simple statistics available without the need for writing lots of separate plugins or creating lots of static BigWig tracks.

I am working on trying to improve usability on this plugin so that I can release it publicly.

**The Basic Problem**

The thing I'm currently having trouble with is that I can't seem to add custom menu items that allow the user to change the settings for the DataAdapter on the track. These things can be customized if the track is copied and then modified, but this is a pretty big hassle for my users. I would like them to be able to change simple options for the data adapter from the track menu similar to how users are allowed to change various display options.

The developer documentation says that custom menu items can be added if a custom track type is created. I have done this, and it compiles. But when I attempt to enable the track I get the error message, ""Error: no containing view found."" This is due to the way getTrackMenuItems is implemented. It expects to find something that is a ""view model"" as defined in the core types.

**The Problem's Cause**

I looked through the source code, and it seems like the only things that qualify as ""views,"" are things that descend from BaseViewModel. Track configSchemas do not. They have no width field or setWidth properties. The only things I can find that add menu items in the core components are Displays.

As far as I can tell, it is currently not possible for custom tracks to add menu items at all (despite what the documentation implies). If I want to add menu items for modifying settings for my DataAdapter I have to wrap and then extend the LinearWiggleDisplay, a wholly different kind of component. This would work, but it feels very messy.

**Possible Solutions**

It seems like the most elegant solution is to allow all types associated with a track to add their own menu items, not just limit it to things that extend from BaseViewModel. This would make separation of responsibilities a lot clearer and would make writing plugins much more straightforward. 

People wouldn't have to add things their plugins don't need just to get access to features like adding track menu items. Right now my plugin exists as a DataAdapter. I have no functional need to fork any kind of Display or even add a custom track type. I fear that if I add these things to my plugin that it will become harder to maintain in the future by increasing complexity.

2003,Make SNPCoverage independently generate the modifications tag-color mapping,closed,internal,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-21T21:54:03Z,2021-05-24T18:46:07Z,2021-05-24T18:46:05Z,"This is a sort of tricky one where the SNPCoverage track, when colorBy modifications is turned on, draws with an uninitialized tag->color mapping

This could be a correctness issue as it could affect first-time rendering

Currently the Alignments track synchronizes the tag -> color mapping from the pileup to the snpcoverage display

One alternative would be to treat the snpcoverage track and pileup track is functionally independent, so they both do their own work to get the color mapping independently

This actually is extra work done, and could result in slowdown, as the getUniqueModifications RPC call is an extra pass through the data. We can count the number of passes through the data like this

So to draw a track, we get something like this

SNPCov - stats estimation
SNPCov - modification tag color mapping
SNPCov - draw pileup, 2-3 blocks, 2-3 passes
Pileup - modification tag color mapping
Pileup - 2-3 blocks=2-3 passes 
~7-9 passes through the data to draw the alignments track.

It could be nice if there was less passes through the data, and this PR technically only adds 1 extra pass to those that are already there."

This upgrades abortable-promise-cache which has a fix for this

It would be ideal if yarn automatically figured this one out, because this upgrade was allowed by semver to get an upgraded abortable-promise-cache

I ran `npx yarn-deduplicate` to achieve this result

I could have also released a new version of @gmod/cram and @gmod/bam specifying a minimum abortable-promise-cache of v1.4.0

This is especially bad for large index files that don't go in the browser cache, so are redownloaded in full

1996,"Updating the colour scheme through ""configuration""",closed,bug,,david-simmons-z,,,2021-05-21T12:36:10Z,2021-07-07T16:45:57Z,2021-07-07T16:45:57Z,"**Describe the bug**

I'm following the guide specified [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/bcc2020_embedding_jbrowse_01_getting_started). I've had no issue with all the procedures outlined. After getting things working, I've gone off piste and tried to update the JBrowseLinearView theme. In short, I cannot get the `JBrowseLinearView` to respond to colour configuration settings that I provide to it.

**To Reproduce**

1. Follow the guide up to [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/bcc2020_embedding_jbrowse_09_reacting)
2. Update the `genomeView` to be
```
const genomeView = new JBrowseLinearView({
container: document.getElementById('jbrowse_linear_view'),
configuration: {
          theme:{
            palette: {
              primary: {
                main: ""#311b92""
              }
            }
          }
        },
assembly,
tracks,
location: '1:100,987,269..100,987,368',
onChange: patch => {
  updates.innerHTML += JSON.stringify(patch) + '\n'
},
})
```
-->

**Expected behavior**

Adding the following component above should change the colour for part of the `JBrowseLinearView`:
```
configuration: {
          theme:{
            palette: {
              primary: {
                main: ""#311b92""
              }
            }
          }
        },
```

This is a little tricky to fix because we need to have a handle on the plugin definitions themselves, and the place where RpcManager is initialized in rootModel doesn't have session.sessionPlugins yet (the model is still initializing so session is undefined)

This takes the approach to store all plugin definitions as plugin metadata, and then adds a getter called PluginManager.pluginDefinitions and this can be used for the workerBootConfiguration

1987,Add ability to customize feature detail fields with configuration expressions,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-18T15:38:38Z,2021-08-10T14:44:57Z,2021-08-10T14:44:57Z,"This is a way to provide customization to the feature detail panels without making a plugin+ making a custom display type + making a custom widget panel

It allows a jexl expression instead in the config so that you can have something like this


    jexl:{hello:'world'}

This would add a field called hello with value world to the feature details

You can also stitch together multiple attributes, or rewrite existing fields. It uses object spread which will overwrite fields or create new ones. This can be used to make links

Example here

    jexl:{civicdb:'<a target=\""_blank\"" href=https://civicdb.org/events/genes/'+feature.gene_id+'/summary/variants/'+feature.id+'/summary>Link to CIVIC</a>'}



This is possibly a bit verbose if you want to provide multiple customization, as it is all contained in one field and possibly on a single line in json. Users facing this issue could make a plugin that adds some custom jexl expressions and then possibly it could look just like this

     jexl:{civicdb: generateCivicLink(feature), otherfield: generateOtherField(feature)}"

This can be mitigated in some cases if you catch the error but we often just let errors go to our top level errorboundary and those messages get shown by both react-error-overlay and the ErrorBoundary

This PR just disables the react-error-overlay effectively (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46589819/disable-error-overlay-in-development-mode) 

Note that this causes hot module reloading to fail https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/10611

1982,Allow manually specifying adapter type if filename does not match expected pattern,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-17T13:09:13Z,2021-05-19T20:10:32Z,2021-05-19T19:53:08Z,Fixes #1885

1980,"Add popup confirmation dialog for unknown session plugins, and use plugins.json as a whitelist",closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-16T18:20:58Z,2021-05-19T20:10:55Z,2021-05-19T18:42:31Z,"We currently have this behavior in jbrowse-web loader

a) trust plugins in a users config file if loading same-origin config
b) prompt against loading cross-origin configs
c) load plugins from sessions (without any checking)


I propose changing it so

a) same behavior, trust plugins in users config file if loading same-origin config
b) trust cross-origin configs if they have plugins that match our plugins.json file (e.g. matches urls from there), only prompt if not
c) trust session plugins if they have plugins that match our plugins.json file (e.g. matches urls from there), only prompt if not

The motivation here is that (c) is sort of a currently existing security hole, and that (b) is not really a security hole after checking whitelisted plugins and change to jexl, so does not need a prompt"

1975,Allow local files on the users computer to be opened as tracks in jbrowse-web,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-14T08:00:18Z,2021-05-24T20:29:38Z,2021-05-19T19:34:33Z,"This is an early result but I had an interest in allowing the ability to upload local files as blob files in jbrowse web. This is a longstanding issue #88

The basic methodology is this

0) realize that you can't store a file blob in a mobx-state-tree state, and our other file handles are mobx-state-tree's so then go to step 1
1) create a mapping of a blobId (something I made up) to the actual file blob
2) make the BlobLocation mst object store this blobId
3) making openLocation read the map to access the file blob given the BlobLocation's blobId

In order to make this work on the webworker, we have to send the map of blobId to the blob over the rpc. This PR sends the entire map  instead of trying to select a single blob off the map for example for smaller payload.

Fixes #88

1972,Example JB2 config that purely uses remote files?,closed,,,bbimber,,,2021-05-13T19:57:44Z,2021-05-19T20:48:37Z,2021-05-19T20:48:37Z,"Hello - we're converting to JB2 and have a question. With JB2 it should be possible to have a config that purely points to resources hosted elsewhere. Do you happen to have an example of such a config that uses relatively stable URLs for a genome and tracks? I'd like to use this for two purposes: 1) automated integration tests would use that, and 2) we have a LabKey modules that wraps JS2. Effectively, we have a server-side API that returns the JSON needed to create the JS2 instance (assembly, tracks, etc.). For demo purposes, I'd like to come up with a dummy config that does not require local flatfiles. 

If you dont easily have this I can figure out my own. We had been using something based on URLs we stole from your JB2 demo page."

1967,Omit configurationSchema snapshot when it matches the default,closed,internal,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-05-12T16:34:22Z,2021-07-05T18:48:32Z,2021-07-02T15:39:03Z,"During pairing @teresam856 and I were thinking about the ""textSearchAdapter"" in her branch. It's an ""optional"" config sub-schema, but the default value of the sub-schema was still showing up in config snapshots, which we thought might be confusing. This is an option we came up with that will omit the snapshot of a configuration schema if the snapshot matches the snapshot for the default value of that schema. We though this might be good as a separate PR.

This can be a bit odd if the whole config matches the default, since it makes the whole config snapshot be `undefined` instead of `{}`. We also had to change a couple places that used `getConf(self, 'renderer').type` to `getConf(self, ['renderer', 'type'])`.

It does have the advantage of removing unused things from our config snapshot, e.g. renderers with no customization:

The main thing is that it needs to unlink the destination before trying to symlink it

It is somewhat of a coincidence that copy behavior is to overwrite by default. I changed it to actually use  COPYFILE_EXCL to avoid accidentally overwriting a destination file, and the user can go back and use --force to overwrite it, which matches the behavior of overwriting the symlink added in this PR

It uses a try catch because if the destination symlink doesn't exist it would otherwise throw

Adds some misc refactoring (could be split out) to  try to simplify or deduplicate some repetitive logic in the code and tests with the hope that simpler code==easier to see code paths

I appreciate your work and project and love the idea to deal with symlinks instead of redundantly stored files. I'm embedding JBrowse for user-configured genome annotation within a Snakemake pipeline. Sometimes, depending on the changed files, Snakemake calls the ""jbrowse add-track"" command multiple times during re-run. Unfortunately, jbrowse is not able to deal with already existing symlinks:

> jbrowse add-track /opt/mosga/snakemake/../gui/uploads/25a87c14/repeats/windowmasker/windowmasker.gff.gz --out /opt/mosga/snakemake/../gui/uploads/25a87c14/jbrowse --load symlink --subDir=Repeats --force -n WindowMasker
>Error: EEXIST: file already exists, symlink '/opt/mosga/snakemake/../gui/uploads/25a87c14/repeats/windowmasker/windowmasker.gff.gz' -> '/opt/mosga/gui/uploads/25a87c14/jbrowse/Repeats/windowmasker.gff.gz'
> Code: EEXIST

The arguments ""--force"", ""--overwrite"", or ""--skipCheck"" do not have any effect. By changing the load parameter from symlink to copy it works again. It would be nice if jbrowse could overwrite or delete and set the symlink again.

Cheers
Roman

**Expected behavior**

Should overwrite the existing symlink.

**Version:**

JBrowse 1.2.0
Ubuntu 18.04
Firefox

I basically looked at all instances searching using ""ag create\("" in the codebase and looked for instances of this pattern, which generally is the renderProps on a model function dynamically creating a renderer config"

It is basically just the demo, it should work in normal usage of the app. But in the demo, there were some weird things happening


- Integration test for breakpoint split view demo was disabled at some point (07/2020), by me (oh dear) which is sort of a root cause of subsequent failures
- Breakpoint split view demo was using chrom.sizes which had refnames with chr prefix, but it wasn't actually testing refrenaming
- Breakpoint split view displayedRegions were using ""6"" instead of the ""chr6"" that was in the assembly, making them pretty much invalid settings
- Breakpoint split view demo did not have refNameAliases configuration to let it adapt between chr6 and 6
- Since it was using invalid settings, the assembly.getCanonicalRefName was not working

<h2>v4.7.7 - February 15th, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>fix weird error in integration tests - eb860c0</li>
<li>fix: check prototype property access in strict-mode (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736"">#1736</a>) - b6d3de7</li>

<li>refactor: In spec tests, use expectTemplate over equals and shouldThrow (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1683"">#1683</a>) - 77825f8</li>
<li>chore: start testing on Node.js 12 and 13 - 3789a30</li>
</ul>
<p>(POSSIBLY) BREAKING CHANGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>the changes from version <a href=""https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020"">4.6.0</a> now also apply
in when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods
can be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633"">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties
from your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you. Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we only bump the patch version despite mentioning breaking changes.</p>

and installs 7.0.0. npm install executes fine. when i run ""npm ci"", it deletes node_modules and reinstalls from package-lock.json. For some incomprehensible reason it leave me with an empty folder for 'pluralize'. I cannot figure out why, but this is one inconsistency I saw.

Have you seen anything like this before?

1942,Add group by tag functionality to alignments tracks,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-06T06:54:13Z,2021-08-10T14:25:08Z,2021-08-10T14:25:08Z,"This is a proof of concept for ""Group by"" functionality on alignments tracks, but maybe some unknowns remain

This screenshot shows grouping by the ""RG"" or read group

It creates an array of subtracks (or subdisplays), which constitutes a pileuptrack that has a filterBy: {tag: 'tag of interest', value: one for each value seen}

Therefore, if there are HP:0 and HP:1 then we create two subdisplays and filterBy HP:0 on one and HP:1 on the other

This is coded up as an ""alignments track specific"" functionality. If we wanted it to be able to be used on a pileup display on its own, it may require some changes. Some stuff that may be considered also:

how to turn on group by and color by?
any way to optimize? it is a little bit unfortunate that this requires multiple passes through the data, basically N+1 passes through the data if it is split into N subgroup tracks (1 pass to setup the groups, N passes on each group...)
some work on creating scrollable subgroups may be needed
etc.

1941,Allow SNPCoverageDisplay to perform coloring and filtering on it's own,closed,internal,,cmdcolin,,,2021-05-06T05:35:21Z,2021-06-18T19:17:34Z,2021-06-18T19:17:34Z,"The currently model for alignments display is that it is a ""parent"" and coordinates some updates for the pileup/snpcoverage displays. For some settings though, namely filterBy, the alignments display explicitly copies any updates to the LinearPileupDisplay.filterBy state to the LinearSNPCoverageDisplay.filterBy. This means that SNPCoverage tracks cannot perform filtering or coloring on their own 

This PR proposes making the filterBy setting part of the alignments parent LinearAlignmentsDisplay state, and then propagating it into the LinearPileupDisplay and LinearSNPCoverageDisplay sub-displays


This is also done for colorBy setting which may help standalone LinearSNPCoverageDisplay to be used with DNA modifications/methylation coloring e.g. #1865


One concern may be that most ""Color by"" options settings don't really apply to SNPCoverage when it's on it's own, but it might be better to reorganize the code architecture this way anyways

This I think had been attempted before, but I tried again just to see...seemed to work

1) yarn upgrade-interactive react-scripts --latest -> up to 4.0.3
1) skip preflight check in .env file of jbrowse-web as this introduces alternative version of jest that conflicts with tsdx's built in version
1) update worker loader to not manually refer to the oneOf[1].plugins since this crashed startup, this also seemed unneeded so line was removed
1) fixed a couple lint errors that prevented startup, including adding eslint-config-react-app to root, and removing @typescript-eslint/camelcase stuff which may be due to similar stuff to here (https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/2077)
1) manually upgrade react and react-dom in package.json of root, jbrowse-web, jbrowse-desktop as yarn upgrade-interactive complained about @babel/preset-env

Maybe --adapterType flag

More custom adapter types may need to use add-track-json or similar

1927,update analytics and session sharing endpoints to use a URL we can move,closed,"enhancement,size small",,rbuels,peterkxie,peterkxie,2021-04-27T16:23:26Z,2021-05-03T13:19:16Z,2021-05-03T13:19:16Z,"Probably a cloudfront url or something? Currently it's logging to https://mdvkjocq3e.execute-api.us-east1.amazonaws.com/default/jbrowse-analytics
"
1926,Update website to link to demos on cloudfront for better compression,closed,internal,,cmdcolin,,,2021-04-27T14:33:07Z,2021-04-28T17:22:30Z,2021-04-28T17:22:27Z,"Xref previous lab talk where I noted that our S3 bucket doesn't have compression enabled...I went ahead and tried turning on a setting to turn on compression on cloudfront with these instructions

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html#compressed-content-cloudfront-configuring

I tried a couple tests loading volvox cram files, etc and it seemed to work fine

This makes overall downloaded content 

Initial load of v1.1.0 is ~1MB total amount downloaded vs before which has 3.9MB downloaded, so the new bundle size is 25% of the size of the old bundle (or a 75% decrease)

Can see comparing

https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse.org/code/jb2/v1.1.0/index.html
https://jbrowse.org/code/jb2/v1.1.0/index.html

So this PR updates demo links to use cloudfront, and removes the ""currentLink"" field in the docusaurus json and instead manually uses currentVersion in template strings

I still believe that things like optimizing bundle size is important, especially since users of jbrowse may not configure their compression properly + just perceived improvements in load time do matter, but if you do have it configured properly it can make a big difference

This makes a global eslint rule to produce an error if it is not, and it is also autofixable too

There are some instances of single-line-if-statements that are still allowed with this, but when it spans multiple lines it should have a curly"
1924,Fix import of BED and navToLocString from spreadsheet views,closed,bug,,cmdcolin,,,2021-04-26T19:01:19Z,2021-04-28T17:20:09Z,2021-04-28T17:20:06Z,"The syntax +item is not available in jexl so I converted to parseInt (with the radix param :))

Also, for example, the variable row.cells.ref.text was not actually existing, the previous code was

var [ref, start, end] = row.cells
ref.text

In jexl form, without destructuring, we use row.cells[0].text

Finally the navToLocString click on cell gave an error for ""model width undefined"" so I moved the view.initialized await above the view.setDisplayedRegions. There was some rearrangement of this code at some point so it works better to check for initialized before setting displayed regions

Currently it is assumed the line following a markdown image like `![](img/blah.png)` is a caption, and this is actually hardcoded as an assumption in the PDF. There is also the suggestion to fill out alt text e.g. `![Alt text here](img/blah.png)`

Currently the webpages don't even display captions that well, and since markdown has no real good concept of a caption, I propose using MDX for this

This PR begins this propagation

It appears to work well on the user guide and quickstart_gui for admin server, so I may continue to propagate it. Images will be moved from website/docs/img to website/static/img since I think it is required to be in static resources for use with mdx maybe https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets

StrictMode does a little ""chaos testing"" like double rendering components which can reveal weird things

In this case, I found sessionStorage from rootModel autorun outputs sessionStorage.setItem('current', JSON.stringify({session}))

The code here in loader was outputting sessionStorage.setItem('current', JSON.stringify(session)) instead

This makes sure to use canonical refname when searching.

There are possible alternatives to this PR

We could try to make all our adapters return features with a field called feature.get('originalRefName') that can be used for purposes like this (note that adapters do receive a parameter called region.originalRefName which is the canonical ref name for the assembly being views to their getFeatures function)

This could either

a) be the adapters responsibility to fill out this field or

Depending on whether or not this is currently implemented, this might be a request for a new feature -or- a request for documentation about an existing feature.

It appears right now that JBrowse2 displays some information about genes using lines and arrowheads. However, it seems like the exon-intron structure (specifically, length of exons) is not currently displayed for our data from AUGUSTUS. 

Has this feature been implemented in JBrowse2? If so, what fields are necessary in the GFF3 file for gene data to make the exon-intron structure visible?"

In order to separate concerns somewhat, it is made as an add on. Comment made in that thread moved here:


In my previous comment (https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/1888#issuecomment-816799144), I suggested how it may be interesting to make data adapters lazily loaded. In that comment there is a branch that tries to lazy load e.g. our @gmod/bam parsers inside the data adapter, but to truly make the entire e.g. BamAdapter class lazily loaded, I made a proposal here that tries to help

https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/tree/lazyreact_dataadapters_alternative_interface

The idea is that getAdapter now is async, and the AdapterType pluggable element can have an AdapterClass or a getAdapterClass->() => Promise<AdapterClass> so that when you define an adapter type you can have

```
pluginManager.addAdapterType(() => new AdapterType({
    configSchema: configSchemaJustLikeNormal,
    getAdapterClass: () => import('./BamAdapter')
})
```

This also means that the capabilities would not be statically available from calling getAdapter which is what some main thread code does, so I made an extra field to make capabilities statically available

BamAdapter.ts

```
export default BamAdapter {
    ...
    static capabilities=[...]
}
const adapterCapabilities = BamAdapter.capabilities 
export {adapterCapabitilies}
```
```
import {adapterCapabilities,configSchema} from './BamAdapter'


pluginManager.addAdapterType(() => new AdapterType({
    configSchema: configSchemaJustLikeNormal,
    getAdapterClass: () => import('./BamAdapter/BamAdapter') # the actual class
    adapterCapabilities
}))
```

Also added support for the session being in a top-level ""session"" attribute on the session JSON so that files created with `File -> Export session` can be used with `set-default-session`
* Adds a `--delete` option to `set-default-session` that removes the ""defaultSession"" from the config. Setting the default session to `null` or `{}` using `set-default-session --session file.json` caused errors, so this adds an easy way to clear the default session."

The fields of epigenetics and now epitranscriptomics have evolved very fast in recent years and there are now a few DNA and RNA modifications which can be detected at single molecule resolution, in particular with Oxford Nanopore sequencing.

In order to avoid the proliferation of non-standard formats to store these modifications there was a long discussion with the samtools team on how to represent all modifications within SAM/BAM format (https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/issues/362), leading to the proposition to use additional flags in the specification to store both modification positions (Mm) and probabilities (Ml) at read level. There can also be multiple modification tracks included within a single read. Here is the link to the Pull Request currently being considered: https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/418. Hopefully the PR will be merged soon and will be part of the official SAM specification.

Several Oxford Nanopore tools to detect RNA modifications already implement the specification ahead of the official release, including Megalodon (https://github.com/nanoporetech/megalodon) and Guppy basecaller. 

An ideal implementation in Jbrowse would display 1 track per modification and per read showing the probability of a modification presence as a color scale, or maybe multiple modification overlaid with different color scales. There is another old issue https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/issues/509 discussing a way to display methylation information, but this is per position and not per read.

Does that sound like it could be easily implemented as a Jbrowse plugin  ?"

Instead of making this specifically a property of ""Color by"", I change this to a separate setting

Then I also make the fading less ""strict"" e.g. right now it is a scale on a 0-90 but I make it on 0-50 because at quality 40, you are 99.99% sure the base call is right (see https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-07-at-1.36.09-PM-768x535.png) and so you really only need to worry at like 20 or less.

The JSON file will be in its own little repo: https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-list
Need a little bit of CI on that repo to copy the plugin list to S3 when the main branch is updated.

And then the docusaurus build would go through that list, fetch the metadata about each plugin, and make a nice plugin list that Google can index and that people can browse on jbrowse.org to see all the cool plugins that JBrowse 2 has.

Plugin metadata is everything in the package.json, plus a plugin logo (svg or png). Plugin icon/logo would be at `jbrowse.plugin_logo` in the package.json.

I tried clearing out ~/.config/@jbrowse/desktop but this does not fix it


clicking on any card such as New session, Linear genome view, or even the gear icon to reset session, results in an infinite loading as far as I can tell


Note that these infinite loading things are typical of any mobx-state-tree snapshot validation which is kind of dangerous

Trying to find out when this happened with git bisect seemed to indicate it is related to the jexl merge

Requirements:

* pluggable text search adaptors
* Two different levels (or should we call them roles?) of indexes:
  * ""aggregate"" indexes that contain data for many different tracks and assemblies
  * ""track-specific"" indexes that contain data for just the track they are attached to
* When searching, the search system will determine which indexes are relevant to the search, search them all in parallel, then aggregate and rank the results and return them. Calls to the search system will probably want to have some kind of search options that specify the scope of the search.


Implementation sketch:

* create new pluggable element type in core called TextSearchAdapterType
* add optional `textSearch` volatile to rootModel that contains a text-searching controller made as a plain Typescript class
* add an optional text search adapter to all track configurations
* add array of text search adapters to root configuration for aggregated indexes
* all text search adapters need to have metadata about what tracks and assemblies they cover, so that searching code can make decisions about what indexes are relevant to use

(source in Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config). I think what is going on in #1786  is that there are Node environment variables that are still set when the client code is being compiled, leading to weird issues.

However, the menu item for ""Set color"" changes the color and is not a callback, making it a solid color

1817,Fix fonts on @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view storybook,closed,bug,,cmdcolin,,,2021-03-19T15:30:19Z,2021-07-07T16:06:33Z,2021-07-07T16:06:33Z,"This issue brought up something with fonts on the react linear genome view

We can remove this animation, and to me, this produces the feeling of the app being faster and snappier. Note that we have a slide in but not a slide out currently so this basically just makes it more even also

Similar things can be done for the menu. Currently, it does a growing expansion that isn't necessarily that laggy but to me, it feels (and is) faster if the menu appears instantly

My operating system menus do not have any delay for example, so it feels more native"

Things you'll note while observing this include that upstream and downstream are fetched in a separate request to the main, because I thought it was a little tricky to get the math right for fetching the sequence in one request with the possibility of hitting the start or end of chromosome boundaries, so I figured I would ensure the integrity of the fetch for the main gene body and then do the upstream/downstream separately

There is nothing really that bad about this, but it tries to show the ""CDS"" sequence for this feature from #1758

Could also pop up a context menu on the link or a dialog box that gives people some options:

* open up tracks that are visible in the current view
* replace the view that you are currently looking at

1790,"Allow MainThreadRpcDriver to skip serialization during RPC, improving main-thread rendering performance",closed,internal,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2021-03-10T18:07:08Z,2021-04-01T21:26:55Z,2021-04-01T21:26:53Z,"The main outcome of this PR is to enable MainThreadRpcDriver-rendered tracks to skip all the serialization and deserialization and render directly. Basically how this was accomplished is that the RPC methods now get the name of the RPC driver, and the RPC method can do different things based on which driver is used. Control over serialization and deserialization was also moved to RPC driver methods (out of the renderer).

There is a branch here that you can test where the web worker has been disabled, so everything is running on the main thread: https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse.org/code/jb2/mainthread_ssr_disable_webworker/index.html

There are a lot of commits, but each one should be a self-contained change, so I'll briefly describe each of them here.

- ef76214
  This adds to the RPC top-level config to make individual drivers configurable. This will be necessary in some cases in future drivers to add e.g. server url. Existing configurations should still work. The config now has a ""drivers"" field, which by default has a main thread driver. Individual products are responsible for adding drivers and changing the default driver if they want (e.g. jbrowse-web adds a webworker driver config and changes the default to that)
- b4f963a
  This allows each display to define an RPC driver name, and if found the RPC manager will use that driver instead of the default for that display
- da28546
  Just adds a tiny bit of typescripting
- 4a59c92
  This adds the rpc driver class name as an argument to the RPC methods' `serializeArguments`, `deserializeArguments`, `serializeReturn`, `deserializeReturn`, and `execute` methods, so that the RPC methods may do different things based on which driver is in use
- 541dde3
  Removes a few unused ts-ignores
- 626e086
  Makes the the RPCMethodType abstract. It was already abstract in its usage, this just formalizes it.
- 173dd05
  Change the variable name `element` to `reactElement` when it is used by renderers
- e591555
  Probably the biggest change here, this factors a FeatureRenderer out of ServerSideRenderer. That way ServerSideRenderer only has logic for basic serialization/deserialization, and logic for things like fetching features are in FeatureRenderer. It also moves fetching of features to the `render` method instead of having it be part of deserialization, so that serialization/deserialization steps are kept pure and can be skipped. This also means that ComparativeServerSideRenderer now extends from ServerSideRenderer instead of the base RendererType, and does not have to duplicate some of its code, because it no longer conflicts with with feature fetching of ServerSideRenderer.
- ddca96e
  Make the models pass their filters as a serilizable filter chain instead of a serialized filter. This will allow them to be used even if the render args don't go through a serialize/deserialize step
- cba7c04
  Remove `cloneArgs` from main thread RPC, which was unused code. Also skip the filtering step since main thread RPC doesn't need to filter out non-clonable things.
- 0f5651f
  Since the layout isn't observable, things like `get blockLayouFeatures()` don't update if e.g. `layout.rectangles` updates. With server-side rendering, this wasn't noticed since the layout was already populated with rects when it got to the client side. In preparation for rendering without the server-side component, this change forces `get blockLayouFeatures()` to not cache its result the first time it's evaluated, when it may have no rects.
- 2ef14c8
  Moving layout generation to the `render` step instead of having it be part of deserialization allows the renderer to still work if the serialization and deserialization are skipped.
- a4e1dc5
  This moves the call of the renderer's `serializeArgsInClient` to the RPC coreRender method. This allows serialization to be different (or skipped) based on the RPC driver in use.
- f2ca495
  There appears to have been some duplication of how the context menu was handled, sometimes in the track and sometimes in the rendering. This removes it from the rendering, which didn't always work when using main thread RPC, and lets the track always handle it.
- e2e6374
  This uses all the setup from the previous commits to allow the coreRender RPC method to skip serialization/deserialization and call `render` on the renderer (instead of `renderInWorker`) when main thread RPC is used.

Making as draft for now because not too sure how to handle the cancel case. Assuming they do not want to load the cross origin config, will have to atleast clear the config in the URL and in the configPath and set it to the default config (config.json). If clearing the config, may have to clear the session since that session may have info recorded using the previous config (such as confirming, loading a view, and then refresh and not confirming/cancel the second time)."

1743,Add color picker and choice of summary score style for wiggle track,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2021-02-25T08:15:47Z,2021-03-05T18:59:08Z,2021-03-04T21:07:08Z,"This adds a simple color picker for the wiggle track

This is almost going too far in a way, and I believe is starting to call into question the duplication of config items into state

I believe the user experience of having to clone a track and use our config editor is not ideal, and I think the track state and track menu helps, but it is causing duplication of code.

However, I also see that the continued use of track state as a way to open up a new opportunity: it offers a conceptually nice way to get config layers:I can simply say something like

    // using concept from @teresam856 for top level config
    getConf(getSession(self).WigglePluginSettings, 'someSetting')

Then I can get a ""global setting"" to apply to all my wiggle tracks a la config layers. This would be otherwise difficult to setup on every individual wiggle track

So there are tradeoffs here, but open to ideas.

Note that other track types like FeatureTrack could enjoy a color picker also"

1733,Proposal: make SSR in LGV optional,closed,enhancement,,garrettjstevens,,,2021-02-23T19:22:23Z,2021-04-01T21:26:53Z,2021-04-01T21:26:53Z,"Currently the blocks in the LGV displays use the model in `serverSideRenderedBlock.ts`. This calls `rendererType.renderInClient`, which means the renderer has to be based on `ServerSideRendererType.ts` (i.e. it can't just be the base RendererType).

I propose making it so that the blocks could use an SSR renderer or a regular renderer, based on a setting (probably in the display).

My motivation for this was in developing the Apollo plugin and talking with @rbuels, it would be nice to have an Apollo Renderer based on our BoxRendererType, but that doesn't use SSR.

I did a basic hack to show that it's possible, and it seems to work ok. I only did it for Pileup and SVG tracks. These links are to live demos. Each one has the same display twice, with current (SSR) rendering on top and new (non-SSR) rendering on bottom.

That logic probably belongs in track MST models instead.

## previous general thoughts

There are some things in the MST models for displays that probably need to move upward in the hierarchy to live in the track models, since they are more related to the behavior of how to interact with the data itself, rather than how to interact with a specific display.

 Example: when a feature is selected, the display is currently making the decision to open a feature details widget, but that seems like it would be more appropriate to be in the track.

Also, composedTrackMenuItems probably belongs in the track.

Note 1: This may need qualification because it can only be done on the primary alignment, which could be obtained via redispatching or just made a qualification of this
Note 2: Get sequence on this sequence track produces error ""failed to find assembly..."" because the ""read assembly"" is not formally added to the assembly manager, which could be something to reconsider possibly
Note 3: Sort of similar 2, but this was sort of difficult to debug because assemblyManager produced an infinite wait on not found assemblyName instead of any error

This adds a threshold based on this so that at least 30% of reads by default would share the indicator. This filters out many false positives I think

In addition to drawing the indicator, I added a ""upside down histogram"" of the interbase info such as clip/insertion. The upside-down nature emphasizes that these do not contribute to the count in the pileup. This captures things below 30%, and that is especially handy when there is a ""region"" that has a lot of clipping or the insertion has a fuzzy position by the aligner, which I think is biologically a real phenomenon (see cuteSV paper for how they call fuzzy insertion positions)

In the case where e.g. as assembly had a `name` of `""hg19""` and `aliases` of `[""GRCh37""]`, if a track configuration used `""assemblyNames"": [""GRCh37""]`, the track would not show up in the track selector, even though it was using a valid assembly alias.

Fixing that then revealed that the track would not display in the LinearGenomeView because the check comparing the track and displayedRegion assembly names was not being performed properly.

The code used ""padding"" as the variable which increased paddingLeft and paddingRight. Just wanted paddingTop and paddingBottom though. We could perhaps say that the use of padding is a bit awkward here but it does the trick

This PR also makes sure that the renderProps for SNPCoverageRenderer gets the right height also that takes into account YSCALEBAR_LABEL_OFFSET, and increases the height of the SNPCov slightly since some pixels are lost due to this padding (40->45px tall. also tried 40->50px but that causes more ticks to show up which is a little busy)"

Also makes it so that stats are available on the base adapter, so that means that all the different adapters types that use some basic stats (which includes, SNPCoverageAdapter, BigWigAdapter, GCCoverageAdapter (#1624), and now BEDTabix for manhattan plot) all don't have to individually implement stats

This is similar to jbrowse 1 where the base seqfeature store has a local stats operation

Then it also adds ability for BedTabixAdapter to choose it's ""score column"" and read column names from the header of the bedtabix file if available

This allows us to choose the column named ""neg_log_pvalue"" in the summary_stats.txt.gz file as the score that is plotted with the manhattan plot from a tabix file prepared from summary_stats.txt.gz from here https://my.locuszoom.org/gwas/236887/

This change makes it so that there is now a `BaseAdapter` class, which is extended by the `BaseFeatureDataAdapter` class (has `getFeatures()`), the `BaseRefNameAliasAdapter` interface (has `getRefNameAliases()`), and the `RegionsAdapter` interface (has `getRegions()`). There is a new interface `SequenceAdapter` that extends both BaseFeatureDataAdapter and RegionsAdapter (has both `getFeatures()` and `getRegions()`).

This allows checks like `isFeatureAdapter()` that will return `false` for `RegionsAdapter`s. A nice follow-up might be to store on the assembly in the assemblyManager whether the sequence has a `RegionsAdapter` or a `SequenceAdapter`, so that UI elements could react to that. For example, we could disable the reference sequence track in the track selector or disable the ""get sequence"" from the rubber band menu if a `ChromSizesAdapter` is being used.

This also adds a `FromConfigRegionsAdapter` for convenience, and removes `getRegions()` from the `FromConfigAdapter`, so if you want to use a sequence adapter from config you have to use the `FromConfigSequenceAdapter` or `FromConfigRegionsAdapter` (this helps avoid situations like [this](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/issues/1623#issue-788495768), where `FromConfigAdapter` is used instead of `FromConfigSequenceAdapter`).

This came up during work on #1616 . Auspice takes very specific JSON files (generated by [Augur](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/index.html#)) as input. This imposes some constraints on the LGV. There is no indexed fasta to work with. To circumvent this, I tried using a `FromConfigAdapter` with the sequence from the JSON stored as a string. The COVID genome is 29,903 bases. This size string caused the embedded LGV to hang considerably when rendering the sequence, or basically doing any actions. This hangs the rest of the app too.

I tried to see if this was also the case for JB2 web, and it is.

@cmdcolin It's also worth noting that the hang seems to causes the translation frames added in #1458 to break.

**Caveat:** I'm not sure how high priority this actually is when not considering the Nextstrain use case. I think in general, I don't really know if this is a problem, since there are better supported ways to add large data to JB2 instead of putting it directly in the adapter."

1. go to https://jbrowse.org/demos/cancer-demo-2020/#embed
2. open hg19 in the embedded lgv
3. click one of the gene names
4. while it loads, scroll up and down with your mouse wheel or touchpad
5. you will see that the scrolling hangs a bit as the processing runs

This is probably a result of using MainThreadRenderer combined with heavy BAM processing. Should be confirmed with profiling though.

Some mitigation strategies:
1. add some yielding
2. fundamental performance improvements in BAM parsing or feature rendering
3. reduce serialization overhead in MainThreadRenderer or RPC in general (like maybe #416).

Before, the clipping increases the count in a base which does not actually have an increased count, and colors it sort of randomly with red because it was what is in the ctx.fillStyle from another SNP

1) Making the breakpoint split view not rely on inspecting the rendered output for splines. This was attempted on the linear-comparative-view branch but we reverted back to just inspecting the rendered output for now
2) Override maxHeight when using breakpoint split view to ensure it gets everything
3) Make it easier for users to change maxHeight themselves via a track menu option or similar

This is kind of multi-part PR that is carried over from the paired alignments viewing.

It tries to offer some new things like coloring, filtering, and sorting options
Fixes #940

coloring alignments by various options, chosen by the track menu. the color by tag offers a possible way to color by arbitrary tag, but currently this is not super general and is a predefined list of some tags

sorting alignments by various options, including by tag (which prompts a dialog box to select a tag, which is a predefined list for now)

filtering alignments #767 by flags. the default filters out PCR dup and QC fail reads. Users can also extend the filtering using both inclusion and exclusion filtering (e.g. only include reads with this flag, exclude all reads with this flag). Similar to -f and -F in samtools. The filter is applied to both the snpcoverage and the pileup at once, which required a couple tricks

Also adds little directional arrows to the alignments features

-- NEW CONTENT --
Color by tag is no longer a set list, instead users will input a two character tag to color by, very similar to IGV. Tags must follow the conventional SAM tag format or submit will not be allowed. After submitting, code will run on the main thread to gather all values for submitted tag on static blocks and assign them a color pairing"

We use JBrowse as part of some NIH-funded projects and want to migrate to JBrowse2. We need the name-indexing/search feature to make that viable. I have developers, and would be willing to try take a stab at porting/adapting the JB1 concept to JB2., contributing this to your project. That would only make sense if we're engaged with your team, including design discussions. The basic blueprint for how to adapt JB1's feature to JB2 has been discussed on other threads and that basically made sense to me. There might be some smaller points to discuss. 

I see there is a prioritized dev item on your project board for this feature. Do you have a sense whether that is realistically being developed soon by your team?  Whatever that answer, is there a useful way we could contribute in a way that meaningfully accelerates this? From my perspective, the sooner the better.

Once we have this in place and have migrated to JB2, my group is very interested in building extensions to JBrowse that leverage your session config file (i.e. defining the tracks), and client-side parsing in order to create other kinds of UI driven by the same data. For example, one might want to render a table of variants/features. That's a separate conversation.

Anyway, please let me know if there's a way we can contribute here.

2. Performance questions of keeping the whole file for spreadsheet in an MST model in the session.

To resolve problem 2, @cmdcolin were wondering if some ""service"" like workflow could be used, where the search/sort/filter operations for spreadsheet could be done in the web worker, or even a lambda.

Idea for implementation: plugin class has an optional property `configuration`, and the pluginManager keeps track of the configurations for registered plugins.

```ts
export default class extends Plugin {
  name = 'MyPlugin'

  configuration = ConfigurationSchema('MyPluginConfig', {
    // config slots here
  })

  install(pluginManager: PluginManager) {}
}
```

And any plugins that defined a config would be added to the top-level config like:

```js
      configuration: ConfigurationSchema('Root', {
        // other slots
        myPlugin: types.maybe(pluginConfigSchema)
      }),

The VcfTabixAdapter already has has a ""About this track"" based on the vcf header, and does mild parsing of the header to make it display using a ""feature details"" style box

This modifies it to not do parsing of the header, and instead print the raw header using a `<pre>` text box

This then applies across many header types including BAM,CRAM,BEDTabix,GFF3Tabix,VCFTabix

In some situations, this could be better, and in some it could be worse. If the tracks have many thousands of refseqs, then there would be many thousands of not-very-informative header lines. Those can be collapsed when we do the mild parsing approach, but not with this raw approach. Is there any preference? We could also have both mild parsing and raw version...

Any thoughts welcome

It has been hypothesized that this is due to weird amazon throttling, because it is intermittent and doesn't affect all users

Ian also ran into this for a VCF file once, which makes it somewhat concerning that it would affect other users

This change would specifically help me, because the cloudfront'ed file has no issue, hence this tiny change.


It is some question of whether this should be done to more of our files. I don't know the details or implications of making cloudfront host giant files that we range request against (could be expensive)

1496,Increase test timeout using jest.setTimeout,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-11-25T03:40:27Z,2021-03-19T15:21:42Z,2020-11-25T16:10:56Z,"In #1471, it's noted that one of the CLI test files sometimes times out in CI. In `fancy-test` (which is what `oclif-test` is based on), there's a syntax for increasing the timeout for a test that looks like

```ts
const wait = (ms = 10) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

describe('timeout', () => {
  fancy
  .timeout(50)
  .it('times out after 50ms', async () => {
    await wait(100)
  })
})
```

However, this appears to be dependent on the test running under Mocha and doesn't work when run with Jest. I tried duplicating the behavior with a Jest-specific action, but didn't have any luck, since Jest and Mocha seem to handle timeouts too differently. We can set a longer timeout for all the tests in a single file, though, using `jest.setTimeout()`. I think this works well enough, and may be the best we can do if we want to continue using `oclif-test`.

The biggest problem was that usually changelogs are grouped under a version number, but since all our packages are versioned independently, and the changelog is for the whole repository, that didn't work. Also, not every package is published during every release. Packages that have no changes are not published and don't have their versions bumped. I tried creating a table in the changelog of all the packages that were changed, what their new version is, if they are published to NPM or not, etc., but it got a bit complicated. It also seems like it would be difficult to decide individually for every package in each release whether the changes deserve a minor or patch bump.

That leads me to the biggest proposal in this PR: **Use lerna to lock all packages to the same version**. That way a changelog can refer to a specific version number, and it's easy to see which changes happened in which versions. Lerna will still only publish the packages that have changed if done this way, so not everything will be published under every version number. I know we decided on independent versioning at some point, but I couldn't remember the exact reason why. I thought this might be a good chance to reconsider that, since we just synchronized everything at 1.0.0, and it would be a straightforward switch.

The other problem I ran into is that some releases may not include a release of JBrowse Web. This could happen if, for example, after a release we found a critical bug in another product, like JBrowse Desktop, that we needed to publish a fix for quickly. If only JBrowse Desktop is changed, and not JBrowse Web, then the release would not include JBrowse Web. I had to change the release script and the automatic blog post to account for this."

1492,LinearSyntenyView unable to plot self-alignment synteny,open,bug,,cmdcolin,,,2020-11-24T05:19:45Z,2021-03-18T01:23:36Z,,"This was known for a little while by me but the LinearSyntenyView is unable to plot self-alignments


This is something that can be a real task, and seems more commonly in dotplots, but basically highlights repetitiveness or other interesting self similarity


The reason for this difference is a sort of weird

The PAFAdapter determines which column to fetch from based on the assemblyName attribute in it's config matching the query assemblyName, and since it is self, it always matches column 1


The Dotplot view actually is able to plot self similarity because it uses feature.mate and so it can handle getting just features from the first column. The synteny view uses matching syntenyID property queried from both columns, but the second column can't get queried right (because it is a duplicate assemblyname)

It's thought that the dominating factor in how the session becomes overloaded with the spreadsheet is due to dom elements e.g. the NxM style thing that the spreadsheet creates

This proposes a pagination limiting us to a number of rows



As much as I would like virtualized seamless scrolling it is challenging to deliver properly as you have to hijack default browser scroll bars


Notes on a couple attempts at trying virtualized spreadsheet

a) if you make a virtualized scroll, you can get some ways into it, however many columns becomes a problem because you have to predeclare a div area to put the virtualization in, and if it is simply a width 100% you can't sidescroll it to get to a large number of columns
b) in this case you are looking at like a 2d virtualizer and that seemed somewhat complex, especially because you then need sticky virtualized column names which is like scrollsync from react-virtualized but this doesn't look that great and feels like non native scroll

the xgrid from mui is nice, didn't try, but the licensing is weird so just avoiding for now

It tries to offer some new things like coloring, filtering, and sorting options
Fixes #940 


1) coloring alignments by various options, chosen by the track menu. the color by tag offers a possible way to color by arbitrary tag, but currently this is not super general and is a predefined list of some tags

2) sorting alignments by various options, including by tag (which prompts a dialog box to select a tag, which is a predefined list for now)

3) filtering alignments #767  by flags. the default filters out PCR dup and QC fail reads. Users can also extend the filtering using both inclusion and exclusion filtering (e.g. only include reads with this flag, exclude all reads with this flag). Similar to -f and -F in samtools. The filter is applied to both the snpcoverage and the pileup at once, which required a couple tricks

Also adds little directional arrows to the alignments features

Instead, I decided to pass the plugin manager as an arg when creating the assembly manager model, which is similar to the way a session model is created.

This seems to work fine, but it led to `pluginManager` being correctly typed in `assembly.ts` (before this it was implicitly `any`), which required some typescript fixes.

Some fixes are because there seems to a bug in docusaurus that if a markdown image alt-text has double quotes (like this: `![alt text with ""quotes""!](../static/img/logo.svg)`), the build breaks: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3751

Another fix updates `tex_parser.md` so that it only tries to extract a caption for an image if there is no alt-text, and only extracts the caption if it's on the next line (no blank lines after it)."

* **build**
  * builds codebase
  * runs build-only tests

While doing so, we made some proposed changes to the quickstart guides.

The proposed flow is to have three guides. First is the general quickstart which installs the JBrowse CLI, downloads JBrowse, and makes sure it's working. The users then have the choice to proceed with configuring JBrowse by using the CLI config quickstart or the GUI config quickstart.

This also adjust some formatting and wording and adds some screenshots so users can confirm that what they've done is successful."

It makes lineargenomeview wait until the assemblies it is using are initialized

1400,Make SV inspector breakpoint split view onClick waitForAssembly if necessary,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-11-04T21:11:28Z,2020-11-05T18:04:58Z,2020-11-05T17:50:31Z,"This contains fixes addressing #1399

1) a fix for the refnamealiasing/resolution for ref seqs that do not provide a refname adapter, yet more fallout from #1350 but hopefully in a good place after this. this is an important one
2) make the breakpointsplitview click make sure assembly with assemblyManager.waitForAssembly
3) fixup some async/await related to that and then the chord click can not use async/await 
since assemblies load via a webworker there can be noticeable delays all over the place with this

1398,Displays,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-11-04T18:15:31Z,2020-12-04T18:31:12Z,2020-11-05T17:34:03Z,"Some main takeaways from this PR:

* A single track config can have multiple displays.
  * When you create a display, you register it with a track type, so tracks know which displays it can have
  * There is a preProcessSnapshot that takes a track config, looks at the displays it has, and adds a default config for any possible displays it's missing
  * If you don't need to use any non-default config for the displays, the displays don't even have to be in the config file. That means when doing `jbrowse add-track`, you can just add the track and not worry about displays at all.
* Can switch between multiple possible displays in LGV
  * Only shows up in track menu if that track has multiple compatible displays for the view
  * For AlignmentsDisplay, this replaces the ""show pileup"" and ""show coverage"" track menu options
  * Another example is for FeatureTracks, you can choose basic, filtering, or lollipop displays

* Enables opening of same track in different views. e.g. a SyntenyTrack can have a DotplotDisplay in a DotplotView, and then that same track can be opened as a LinearSytentyDisplay in a LinearSyntenyView.

Approach: change from using a elongated polygon to a rectangle with a small triangle that is added to the ends of features that end in the current view. This is somewhat easier to keep track of than all the cases where we need to render partial length rect as a result of the -100000000+100000100 stuff not rendering, and then rendering the pointed directionals

The error occurs when I try to switch the type of adapter for the assembly. When I switch from BamAdapter to BgzipFastaAdapter it throws: ""Error: Error: HTTP 404 fetching /path/to/seq.fa.gz.fai"". Seems like I problem with trying to interpret the default value.

Doesn't happen for the human basic demo, or an empty config (which is what I was testing with.)

To reproduce:

1. Build jbrowse-web
2. Copy the contents of `test_data/volvox` into the root of the build directory.
3. Run `jbrowse admin-server` inside the build directory.
4. Open the Assembly Manager
5. Create new assembly
6. In the config editor, switch from Bam Adapter to BgzipFastaAdapter

Not sure what the problem is with why it is immediately looking for that file and throwing an error for this demo compared to having either the basic human config, or a default one."

Also updates the lambda to make the session id shorter and the full hash is not generally needed, just a small amount of randomness. This change is already live

<!-- Put a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
I expect the zig zag patterns to render even when we do a horizontal flip.
context(the presence of zigzag patterns indicate that the region displayed in the overview is a section of the parent region, if the displayed region and the parent region have the same then no zigzag indicators will appear).  
In the screenshots below, we are rendering regions that are smaller than their parent regions so the zig zag patterns should remain no matter the HF

1355,LGV side-scrolling broken on Firefox+MacOS,closed,bug,,rbuels,,,2020-10-30T04:44:54Z,2020-10-31T06:27:30Z,2020-10-31T05:10:32Z,"<!-- Please fill out as much of the template as you can. -->

Mac touchpad 2-finger scrolling of the LGV pane does not work well on Firefox+MacOS

In a statement from GitHub (see more details [here](https://github.com/github/renaming)):

> Many communities, both on GitHub and in the wider Git community, are considering renaming the default branch name of their repository from `master`. GitHub is gradually renaming the default branch of our own repositories from `master` to `main`.

Also, starting this month, new repos created by any user on GitHub have a default branch of `main`.

In order to try to be more inclusive, I propose we change our default branch name. Since we have the 1.0 release coming soon, it could be a good time to make this change, and also think about how we want our branches structured. A couple possibilities:

* Change `master` to `main` and continue our workflow the same way it is now. If you want to get the repo in the same state as the latest release, use the release tags.
* Change `master` to `main`, and create a `development` or `dev` branch where daily development is done. The dev branch is then merged into master each release.
* Change `master` to `development` or `dev`, and then have a non-default `main` branch that we merge to when we release so there's always a branch with the latest release.
* Various other naming schemes are possible."

- Removes the checkLocation concept (e.g. checking for a manifest.json) except for in the case of jbrowse upgrade which should supply a path with a manifest.json
- Removes resolveFileLocationWithProtocol in add-track replacing it with an inline logic
- Removes the live-checking that a URL exists before adding it. If this is really desirable, we can add it back but I think it's better to let the tool be something that just does stuff rather than validate everything down to whether a url that they supplied is valid
- Adds --subDir argument to add-track so that when I say --load copy --subDir bam then it copies the file to a bam subdirectory near target
- Adds a --protocol argument that allows the user to manually specify the protocol used for the user to manually supply this, since it's not really able to be automatically determined. uri is used by default

Currently assembly.ts does a getParent(self, 3).setError which works on web but not desktop. 

Note that on web, this getParent(self, 3).setError is basically root model I think, and then makes the entire app fail to load. 

Maybe instead it would be better to do a self.setError, and have that error only apply to the failed assembly?"

It is getting a Uint8Array instead of a Buffer (possibly?) and then Uint8Array.toString is not sufficient to transform this to a string.

You can add tracks using the CLI but the only way to remove tracks is to directly edit the JSON file. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**

A CLI command that lets you remove tracks given the name or track id--and maybe the category as well (i.e remove all tracks for a given category).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

The alternative right now is to edit the `config.json` directly (or for bulk removal, use a script). 

**Additional context**

Having many tracks or assemblies in the config exacerbates the issue.

1308,Make the track selector button more obvious/intuitive,closed,enhancement,,shihabdider,,,2020-10-14T22:22:04Z,2020-11-24T22:28:29Z,2020-11-24T22:28:28Z,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

If a user closes the track selector after selecting some tracks, the only way to open the selector again is to press the track selector button on the top left of the view or to use the hamburger menu. Both are a bit unintuitive (since initially you select tracks with a button in middle of the view).

**Describe the solution you'd like**

1. Change the button from an icon to text and move it to the far right of the screen (i.e the same side as the track selector). 
2. Make it so you can click the button to toggle the track selector open and closed. Currently, it only opens the selector, after which you have to close using the cross button. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Instead of changing the button from icon to text, it might be better to simply include the icon in the initial select track button. The consistency would then help the user make a connection between the icon and its function. In this case a bit of pop-up text to the tune of ""Select Tracks"" when hovering over the button would also help clarify things.

**Additional context**

It's not clear that the user should use the view's hamburger menu or the little button to the left to bring back the track selector for that view. Moving this button closer to the track selector and changing it's appearance so its more consistent with the initial button the user is presented with would help the user understand its function.

It's not entirely intuitive where the user is supposed to go from here.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I think one possible solution would be to replace this screen with the ""previous sessions"" menu that was presented in this week's lab meeting (Oct 13. 2020). This would allow a returning user to quickly go back to what they were doing without having to navigate through the toolbar. For new users, maybe just a ""start new session"" box. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

We might also think about extending this idea wrt recommendations and analytics. For instance, we could use the ""session gallery"" to present recommended sessions as thumbnails and record which ones are chosen (a way to do A/B testing).

When there are many tracks and many categories, having all the category folds open by default makes scrolling through the track selector unwieldy. The search filter is useful when you know the name (either in part or whole) of the track you're looking for but if you're searching for a track through the categories, it can be annoying to have to close all the folds.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Make all the folds closed by default.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Another good alternative might be an ""open all/close all folds"" toggle.

We're trying to set up JBrowse (human/cancer) to come ""fully loaded"" with default datasets. However, many of the datasets we would like to include are supersets/subsets/overlapping with each other.

For example, the UCSC dataset (and to a lesser extent Ensembl) overlap with a lot of the other datasets of interest: UCSC has the Uniprot protein domains, GDC tracks for tissue types, gnomAD exome/genome tracks, 1000genomes, TCGA gene and transcript expression data and a few others not mentioned here but probably also relevant (e.g targetDb, gtex, dgv). 

(h/t @shihabdider)

**Describe the solution you'd like**

In the config files for these tracks, if we could refer to files via their MD5 (or SHA-whatever) hash, we would not pay any penalty for duplication. (If we re-use styling and other metadata sections of the config file, and use MD5 hashes for those files, we can readily duplicate their config too.)

Ways I can imagine doing this:

1. A crude but effective way to do it, that can still easily be implemented in an S3 bucket or other dumb static site, is by hacking the filenames. Effectively demand a part of the  simply to define a by-convention REST API something like `/cache/0123456789abcdefdeadbeefcode6502` where `0123456789abcdefdeadbeefcode6502` is the MD5 hash of the file. This can be easily implemented in multiple ways on different servers, e.g. by creating a parallel set of symlinks/hardlinks/redirects/301s/307s etc, or using a DynamoDB cache, or whatever. Maybe you add slashes to the path to break up the MD5 hash, e.g. `/cache/slash4/0123/4567/89ab/cdef/dead/beef/code/6502` to avoid overburdening filesystems... though that is messier...
2. Perhaps more sophisticated (and/or complimentary) would be to add an assertion about the MD5 hash of the file, which the client could use when trying to GET it from the server, e.g. by using the (not very consistently-supported, officially-obsolete) [Content-MD5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1544) header field, or (by convention) adding ""&md5key=0123456789abcdefdeadbeefcode6502"" to the URL query parameters

Not sure of the best way... these are just ideas... it seems like this (MD5 caching to detect/avoid repetition) should be a ""solved problem""


**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I mean, you can already DO this if you want, completely as part of the data pipeline. Just store files by hash name, and/or create those symlinks from `/my/track/datafile.bam` to `/cache/0123/4567/89ab/cdef/dead/beef/code/6502` on the server filesystem. But even if we do it hackily/idiosyncratically like this, might there be room a JBrowse convention for how to do it, that adds value... e.g. defining a policy/schema for admins to make Content-MD5 assertions about data files at particular paths (or URLs generally, including possibly external URLs) from within the config file?

1300,Upgrade TSDX,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-10-13T03:56:16Z,2020-10-13T14:21:16Z,2020-10-13T14:21:08Z,"Fixes #1298 

The reason bug #1289 showed up in Travis builds was because if you run `yarn build` on just jbrowse-web, it builds from the uncompiled plugins. But if you run `yarn build` on the whole repo (like Travis does) it builds the plugins first and then builds jbrowse-web from the compiled plugins. The bug was in the plugin compilation, so it showed up in the Travis build.

I tracked the bug down to `babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises`, which is used in TSDX's rollup config. Under some circumstances, the code was being compiled down to something like this:

```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    const _this = this
    super()
    // stuff that uses `_this`
  }
}
```

Since `this` was being accessed before `super()`, it failed. It looks like `babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises` is known to be a bit buggy, though, since TSDX removed it in https://github.com/formium/tsdx/commit/2aefc3d776d7d3e0d9e645c8e5263c6623e987c9. Luckily, the latest version of TSDX contains this fix, so we can update to that.

Upgrading TSDX brings Jest 25 into our dependencies, which `react-scripts` doesn't like, so we add Jest 24 as a devDependency of jbrowse-web (this is a special case of having a devDependency not in the root `package.json`).

Upgrading TSDX also broke parsing of [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining), and after a bunch of digging I found out that it was because of the root `.browserslistrc` (which was presumably getting referenced by `@babel/preset-env` somewhere). I removed the file to allow it to use the defaults, which fixed optional chaining parsing. I don't think `.browserslistrc` was being relied on by any other code since all the places we call `@babel/preset-env` we specify `target`, which overrides browserslist, and jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop override browserslist in their `package.json`s.

Also removes a couple of now-unused `tsdx.config.js` files as well as `rollup-plugin-scss` (SCSS was removed in #1270)."

An add on automation step could be to populate the github release page and/or blogpost with changelog contents but wasn't sure how to do that quite properly (also, the desktop and jbrowse-web could have unique changelogs so directly including changelog in blogpost may be ambiguous.

For example, we have CircularView not CircularGenomeView, or DotplotView not DotplotGenomesView. I propose changing it to LinearView (or at least changing the name of the package to `@jbrowse/linear-view` instead of `@jbrowse/linear-genome-view`).

If people like the current name, or if it's too ingrained to change it, that's fine with me. I just thought I'd bring up in case we wanted to change it before we publish things."

* Moves packages from the `@gmod` to the `@jbrowse` npm namespace, following essentially the same naming scheme that `@babel` uses:
  * Core packages look like e.g. `@jbrowse/cli`, `@jbrowse/core`
  * Plugins look like e.g. `@jbrowse/plugin-alignments`, `@jbrowse/plugin-circular-view`
  * Third-party plugins would be named something like `jbrowse-plugin-stuff` or `@scope/jbrowse-plugin-stuff`
* package.json files have been updated to be more consistent and have more information
  * ""author"" on all packages is now ""JBrowse Team""
  * Added homepage, bugs, repository, and keywords to most packages
    * I added ""jbrowse"" and ""jbrowse2"" as keywords, any others I should use?
  * Added to each package `""private"": true` or `""publishConfig"": {""access"": ""public""}`, depending on whether or not it should be published
    * For now only publishing plugins that `@jbrowse/react-linear-view` will use, not publishing others
* Remove `generator-jbrowse` package. It might still be a good idea to have a generator for plugins someday, but that package probably wouldn't even be a good starting point for a future generator.
* Rename gff3tabix plugin to gff3, in line with the naming for our other plugins (e.g. variant and bed plugins, which have inside them vcfTabix and bedTabix adapters)"

1279,Use conventional commits to fix changelog generation,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-10-06T18:31:52Z,2020-11-24T19:52:36Z,2020-11-17T22:17:27Z,"This is a proposal for #1257 

This adopts ""conventional commits"" and adds a git commit hook to make sure we try to keep this up to date

Commit messages use a format like ""fix(packagename): description of fix"" or ""feat(packagename): description of feature"" 

There are other types like build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, refactor:, and more. The packagename is also a freetext, it doesn't automatically have to associate with any specific package from our monorepo, but it is probably best to use the monorepo package names.


Following this, I tested out a ""release process"" using

```
npx lerna version prerelease --no-push --no-git-tag-version

```

This generated changelogs for the release process locally

This automatically instantiated CHANGELOG.md files in all packages across the board. I removed these from the PR since it was a test release but think this is basically a way forward. There is still the behavior of things that depend on core getting their version bumped if core gets it's version bumped. This will result in the dependencies CHANGELOG having a note about what changed in core.

There is an alternative system called lerna-changelog that inspects your github repository for PRs and stuff, and is used by the docusaurus repo which was a point of comparison, but I couldn't get it to work and I think conventional commits is a bit more striaghtforward"

1277,Warning in tests/MainThreadRpcDriver: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server,closed,bug,,garrettjstevens,,,2020-10-06T16:39:22Z,2021-04-01T21:26:53Z,2021-04-01T21:26:53Z,"This warning shows up in tests on master branch (see e.g. [here](https://travis-ci.com/github/GMOD/jbrowse-components/builds/188210623)) and anytime that MainThreadRpcDriver is used:

```
Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server, because its effect cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format. This will lead to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this, useLayoutEffect should only be used in components that render exclusively on the client. See https://fb.me/react-uselayouteffect-ssr for common fixes.
```

It looks like this is related to Material-UI, and the warning appears when server-side rendering is done in an environment where a DOM is detected (like when everything is done in the main thread, which we do in out tests). Further reference: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/15798"

Open a couple tracks
Delete one of those tracks from the config.json
Refresh the page

Expect: The track that was deleted will not be present on the refreshed page

Note that ""all views would need to implement this functionality"" as implemented here"

Moves sorting from volatile to real track state

This also required updating AlignmentsTrack's autorun to make it capable of reloading the subtrack state

This would allow you to send a ""session link"" with a sort enabled on it. I like to imagine a screenshot service if that seems kind of unuseful.

Other track states like color scheme, linking reads etc were attempted in #1231 "

- Reflection on the prototype getters for the BamSlightlyLazyFeatures features, similar to how it is  done for CramSlightlyLazyFeatures
- Use MD and CIGAR capitalized in the codebase, making capitalization sensitivity a bit higher (pre-serialization doesn't toLowerCase)

This changes the default props of various of the Material-UI components to use smaller versions (e.g. `size=""small""`, `margin=""dense""`) using the theme. We were already manually specifying most these props anyway. This way they can be specified in one place and we don't have to worry about specifying them each time they are used. Also, someone could override the theme and use bigger components if they wanted."

  * This means we can use `theme.tertiary` without ts-ignoring it, since a JBrowse theme will always have the property
* Theme can be customized with top-level config
  * Theme object defined in configuration will be deep-merged into the JBrowse theme defaults before running `createMuiTheme`. Can override colors, spacing, font size, etc. using this, e.g.:
```json
{
  ""configuration"": {
    ""theme"": {
      ""primary"": { ""main"": ""#ff0000"" }
    }
  }
}
```
* Use ThemeProvider when rendering in worker and hydrating in main thread so renderer can use theme
* Get rid of last two remaining SCSS files. One was removed, one was converted to use `makeStyles`/`useStyles`.
* Use react-syntax-highlighter instead of prism for highlighting config slot code, which removes the last CSS dependency
* Remove `mini-css-extract-plugin` workaround from JBrowse Web since it doesn't have any CSS anymore (fixes #37)

As a demo of how the renderer can respond to the theme, here's what the DivSequenceRenderer now does, lightening up the colors to provide more contrast on a dark background:

1268,Fix SV inspector view,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-10-04T18:45:46Z,2020-10-06T16:12:38Z,2020-10-05T16:48:39Z," PR #1249 broke SV inspector view unfortunately. Basically the cause was that we created generatedTrackConf but this was not added to the tree so using showTrack(generatedTrackConf.trackId) and then using resolveIdentifier did not work

I made it so there is an alternative interface, addTrackConf, on the circular view model, that helps with this scenario

I tried using a viewTrackConfs similar to what exists on dotplot/synteny views, e.g. adding the config to the tree to a specialized spot on the view only, but this made the live updating after spreadsheet filters were applied not update the view.

1267,Add a sequence cache backing indexed fasta,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-10-04T04:08:47Z,2020-10-05T16:50:02Z,2020-10-05T16:49:50Z,"This adds a sequence cache for the indexed fasta

I found that trying to view the HG0096 high cov dataset was quite slow even when pretty zoomed in

Performance tracking revealed many many unzipping operations for tiny chunks of the bgzip indexed fasta

This is due to seqFetch calculating the MD tag for BAM, trying to unzip very tiny chunks sequence data repeatedly, e.g. each feature. Note that CRAM also benefits here since it uses the same seqFetch strategy



This adds a cache layer that extracts sequence chunks 128kb in size, and then slicing that as needed, for all operations involving sequence fetches. This is easier than trying to optimize the seqFetch operation specifically

Found a lengthy thread that I didn't read entirely but found that updating mobx-react made the warning go away. Looks like it does something like ""queued force updating now""

1264,Dotplot gets confused when there are overlapping displayed regions,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2020-10-03T02:08:40Z,2021-08-25T13:54:08Z,2021-08-25T13:54:07Z,"![t1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6511937/94980851-79b2de80-04fb-11eb-8594-d64f9ab0b5ed.png)

* Adds a getInfo function for BamAdapter,CramAdapter,VcfTabixAdapter that returns some header info
* Makes an RPC call for CoreGetInfo that can be fed an adapter config, and adapters can respond with a getInfo function
* Tries to make things like entries from the BAM header usefully visible even though they are sort of complicated little structures. We could print raw text but instead we print JSON-ified versions of the header (because this is what both BamAdapter and CramAdapter expose, they don't provide raw text currently though we could if needed)
* Track config snapshot is also displayed
* The SQ lines from the BAM header are hidden by default because there could be many thousands if there are a large number of refseqs, but there is a button to show them called ""Show hidden entries""
* Copies some display code similar to BaseFeatureDetail, but doesn't import that code directly as a dependency

Occasionally, there would be an error where the string match in `killExpress()` which I use to kill the express server after tests where it is started would return `null`. I got rid of posting `adminKey` for the shutdown, and the flakiness seemed to go away. 

I'm not totally sure what would cause this to intermittently fail, since the match would have to work once before hitting this code. But seems to be solved. The adminKey would already have been checked in the test, and this change doesn't affect test logic."

1) More compact menus
2) Making global typography smaller
3) Use FormGroup row to keep controls inline in the header, and make them all the same height (kind of annoyingly intricately hardcoded still but might be a little better). There was some sensitivity to changing things like theme.spacing e.g. from 4->8 caused the lgv header layout to get distorted, so hopefully this is a little better
4) Removes the little x icon on the refseq dropdown

It has to manually specify the height of certain things, but it puts them all in a little better and more consistent vertical spacing

1254,"Make static block calculation tied to window width, and remove extra block",closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-09-30T00:23:36Z,2020-10-02T19:21:23Z,2020-10-02T17:52:33Z,"This fixes #718 and also removes, at least by default, the usage of the ""extra"" block concept.

The extra block concept means that an extra block on either side of the normal calculation is added. This was done early on by me in order to make sidescrolling feel faster by pre-empting the data to the left and right of the screen. My feeling is that currently, this might downloads more data than is needed especially with large data files (however with long reads, large amounts of data to the left and right are parsed anyways since the reads are just very long)

Using this branch results in ~20% speedup (saves 10 seconds, 50s vs 60s) on a ultra long read BAM dataset from nanopore

Tying the static block calculation to window width makes it so that opening/closing a drawer does not cause a rerender, which can take awhile for larger datasets, so it feels much snappier. I think tying it to window width is not really a bad option either. Can imagine that it's a little less ""pure"" that manually providing the width but it works well here"

BAM used insertion length 1, and had a comment that was carried from jb1-jb2 but was originally committed in 2013 that said

//// GAH: shouldn't length of insertion really by 0, since JBrowse internally uses zero-interbase coordinates?

This is a demo with missing pieces, but it does have some expected functionality



Notes

(a) There is no way to turn on a connection e.g. no area for this in the track selector
(b) The ""height of the virtualized tree"" has to be pre-specified, and to avoid having a scroll within a scroll in the drawer panel, I  do some tricks to calculate how tall the virtualized area is
(c) The nodes are not styled, it is a plain `<input type=""checkbox"">` basically. We could possibly adopt some material-ui styling but unclear if that would be compatible
(d) Sometimes there are some blank gaps in the virtualized tree, see below
(e) Tests don't pass due to not being able to click htsTrackEntry currently, not sure why there
(f) Unclear how very long track names or category names can work, the react-virtualized-tree has a demo for this (nodes with automeasure https://diogofcunha.github.io/react-virtualized-tree/#/examples/node-measure)
(g) Track filter doesn't work yet but we might be able to do something about this

1242,Add assembly fix when outside of directory,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-09-25T22:00:01Z,2020-10-26T18:03:58Z,2020-10-23T18:53:30Z,"With this PR I can say


jbrowse create mydir
jbrowse add-assembly ~/volvox.fa --out mydir --load copy

This will copy the files in there and copy them

I also make --out a synonym of --target, and allow using only the foldername instead of directly pointing to a config.json file. This much more commonly matches my expectations of a ""data directory"", which is what we are building with these commands (files are copied to the directory, etc making the fact that this is a directory an important feature)

 I can propagate this through other files beyond add-assembly if it makes sense.

I also remove the check for manifest.json

I find this check for manifest.json does not fit with my expected workflow with the jbrowse app, and propose removing it. I prefer to not have to type --skipCheck or --force or some combination of this for every command that I run, and would like to not have to be inside the directory to use the command without --skipCheck

Option 1: Use sessionStorage over localStorage. sessionStorage persists across refresh and restore, but does not persist across different tabs and is cleared upon tab closing. Only when user hits save UI button does the current session get saved to localStorage. This way localstorage fills slower. Saved sessions refer to everything in local storage

Option 2: Use localstorage, add a saved key to the value saved in local storage. Currently, local storage looks like =
key: uuid
value: { sessionObject }
With this would be changed to
key: uuid
value: { session: {sessionObject}, saved: boolean }
Then on tab close, localStorage garbage collects itself and clears all objects without the saved: true. Saved get flipped to true when user hits save UI button. This options allows for the same current session to persist across tabs since localstorage has not run the garbage collection part yet

TODO: fix tests after above has been decided

This PR completely rehauls how sessions work. Instead of having a sessionQueryParam with the whole base64encoded session included in the URL, it works as follows
1. When user starts JBrowse, on new session it generates an uuid + current snapshot of the session and is saved to local storage. If the url contains a session param, it searches local storage for a matching uuid and loads that session
2. while user is working, the session is continually updated in local storage
3. when user wants to share, they click the share ui button which triggers a lambda function. The current session gets base64encoded and encrypted before being written to the DynamoDB. User will see a dialog box with their shareable URL, this URL contains the sessionID param that is used to look up the matching sessionId in DynamoDB, and it contains a password used to decrypt the data received back from the DB. This password only exists in the URL, no where else.
4. When another user receives the shared URL and loads the site, it will read from the DynamoDB using the sessionID, find the encrypted session, and send it back. Locally, the session will be decrypted and assigned a local uuid before being written into localStorage

savedSession has been changed, previously it was an array that was part of the jbrowseModel, and now it completely refers to the localStorage to find all savedSessions

default session naming has changed to be more readable, looks like New Session 2020-09-24 13:12:44"

1231,Paired read rendering,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-09-20T18:52:08Z,2020-11-18T22:07:31Z,2020-11-18T22:06:30Z,"This was a curiosity project to try to add paired read rendering to JB2, using ideas from JB1

I think it is an important thing to support proper paired read rendering because it can be helpful for SV visualization

This also includes a number of riders including

1) Making sortedBy an autorun, using technique similar to wiggletrack with ready flag
2) Making colorScheme, a method for drawing color on the pileup track features. I think given the complexity of color logic it is helpful to implement it outside of color callbacks, making colorcallback a different option that is only run on ""normal"" mode of colorScheme
3) Making sortedBy, showSoftClipping, and colorScheme a non-volatile state. Note that, these are kind of like config variables but we are moving them into state because it is really something someone might toggle for a session rather than want to permanently update their config, and therefore also doesn't require a track clone. More things that might not want to make a full track clone but want to edit some settings could use this technique
4) Adding paired read rendering and association, which gathers two paired end reads into a single read using jb1 style approach, with getExpandedRegion to fetch data for a given insert size expansion window


Also includes

1) Removing some getters on Bam/Cram features helpers for flags, instead favoring bitwise calculations directly on the flags field. This cleans up the feature details dialog and makes less serialization of data, and is just a little more straightforward (don't have to memorize our weird terminology for the getters)
2) Fix bug related to read clipping appearing as mismatches in the SNPCoverageRenderer. This is visible on master if you look at the volvox-sv track, and makes for example softclipping on the ends of the reads use the color of the last used SNP letter. Future improvements to SNPCoverageTrack could render other things such as deletion, insertion, softclipping but for now removal fixes this bug
3) Making AlignmentsTrack able to reuse the state of the PileupTrack/SNPCoverageTrack subtracks, related to the fix of of making sortedBy, etc non-volatile (see update to AlignmentsTrack's autorun about setPileupTrack, setSnpCoverageTrack)



Some other notes
- Can't pair reads across different refseqs, this remains a challenge and I believe would not be addressed by this PR. I believe this PR is ""still useful"" as breakpoint split renderer can connect reads across different refseqs
- No arc renderer. If arc renderer was to pair across different refseqs, without breakpointsplitview but it might be a separate track type
- No insert size statistics yet

Note that this could be broken up into a couple bug fixes and stuff, especially if this pr is in limbo for awhile probably would be good to get a couple onto master

**Describe the bug**

When trying to change the order of tracks in JBrowseLinearView (like moving the variants tracks above the gene's one) the component crash when the mouse move above another track.

Two exceptions are thrown when crashing in the console: 
```js
Error: no containing view found
```
And
```js
[mobx] Encountered an uncaught exception that was thrown by a reaction or observer component, in: 'Reaction[observerha]' Error: no containing view found
```
I've tried to reproduce the error in JBrowse-web and didn't get any crash. Maybe it's due to JBrowseLinearView expecting to be in another component/environment like in JBrowse-web ? 

**To Reproduce**

Code is based on course `Embedding JBrowse 2 in your website, BCC2020`

1. Import JBrowseLinearView through script tag like described [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/bcc2020_embedding_jbrowse_03_simple_site#add-jbrowse).
2. Create a div with specific id.
3. Create assembly and tracks object like describe [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/bcc2020_embedding_jbrowse_04_assemblies) and [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/bcc2020_embedding_jbrowse_05_tracks)
4. Create an instance of JBrowseLinearView:
```js
      const genomeView = new JBrowseLinearView({
        container: document.getElementById(""jbrowse_linear_view""),
        assembly,
        tracks,
        location: '1:35,507..48,359',
      });
```
4. Open two tracks
5. Try to move a tracks above another by drag an drop

Notes

1) Very minimal set of changes, checks if admin mode in addTrackConf, diverts to rootModel.jbrowse if so, otherwise adds to session.sessionTracks
2) Then we generateHierarchy(session.tracks.concat(session.sessionTracks)) for the hierarchical track selector

This is very minimal nicely and allows refreshing the page and keeping your added track if it is a URL

Other notes
1) Does not know how to handle refreshing a local file that was opened, might want to check for that
2) Has xss related to config callbacks in the URL

1200,Use build framework for more plugins,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-09-11T23:28:35Z,2020-09-16T23:46:24Z,2020-09-16T23:46:20Z,"This uses the framework introduced in #1180 to add a build system to more of the plugins. A couple notable things:

* When all packages are built using `yarn build` in the root, it now constructs a dependency graph and builds them in that order, regardless of whether they are plugins, packages or products.
* Had to replace `require`s with `import` statements for the built versions to work. These were used in a few places to do `jbrequire(require('./someFile))`."

1) Make the window a bit smaller than full screen. I have window.innerWidth=1378 window.innerHeight=668. I think smaller height especially triggers it

3) This autoscrolls the page down and creates a new LGV at the bottom

This has fairly good behavior on both importing and the generated columns that we have

It would not work if someone manually changed their column to LocString and it was not previously guessed to be a LocString column. The SpreadsheetModel.setColumnType would need to be able to handle this if that was the case

Nevertheless, this is basically working nicely for the simple circumstances we are using now

1186,overview bar contains set of displayed regions instead of assembly-level chromosomes,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,teresam856,teresam856,2020-09-09T21:02:45Z,2020-10-30T18:30:39Z,2020-10-30T18:30:39Z,"I know this is somewhat re-jangling things up after they are where they are but I think that if the overview bar was simply the set of displayed regions, also in the orientation of the displayed regions, then it would behave better.


Issues

- The zoomToDisplayedRegions has complex logic for click and drag across discontinuous regions
- The overview bar does not currently draw displayed regions so the polygons being discontinuous results in some weirdness. Potentially this alleviated by drawing the displayed regions on the overview,  but I propose making the displayedregions equal to the overview regions
- The centerAtBase functionality will need to clone zoomToDisplayedRegions functionality to make it work
- Complex display

Here is a current screenshot of how horizontal flipping looks on volvox

Before flip
![localhost_3000__config=test_data_volvox_config json](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6511937/92652735-59588100-f2bb-11ea-9ccd-0e57ed97a0a9.png)

After flip, no scrolling done

In my vision, the overview bar would reflect the displayed regions and be horizontally flipped as well which results in:
- no hourglass polygons
- actually can use a single or more simple polygon connecting to the overview

Letting this go a bit further, if there are duplicate displayed regions, those would be duplicated in the overview bar as well. This would make overlapping overview polygons pointing at the same region become expanded, and then makes interacting with the overview bar via click and drags behave more intuitively

Also, when creating a discontinuous displayedRegions, the overview would still present basically a single or simple set of polygons instead of several polygons pointing to discontinuous regions on the assembly

The question might be, why would we remove this useful functionality that locates ourselves in the chromosome. I think that we get

- simplicity of visualization
- simplicity of code
- opportunity to design a different overview where, for example, an entirely different view could take care of displaying the genome context. whole genome overviews are important but my feeling is that ""too much"" is being packed into the header bar"

I added these steps to help fix it

- ~~Removes some exception throwing in parse loc string, instead returning an undefined result, which is to be handled by code. This is sort of in the ""spirit"" of the robustness principle here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle I really do like exceptions/assertions for truly exceptional things but having unknown refName from parseLocString seems like a normal runtime condition, not an exception~~
- Reduce dependence on isValidRefName in parseLocString. I allow it to be a function that by default just returns true.  In the case of this sort, I think it is better to allow it to be a true identity function. My reasoning was that having isValidRefName in a tight sort loop is unnecessary, and we know it will have a valid locstring format here, so rely on that.
- The above change to allow isValidRefName being a ()=>true callback required removing a check for isValidRefName(prefix) and isValidRefName(location) both being true being a fail condition"

This notifies the user that the limit has been hit, but they are allowed to force a load which would temporarily raise the limit to match the current bpPerPx (this is in volatile so it does not persist upon refresh). Users can also raise the maxViewBpPerPx in the config if they want to persist a higher or lower limit. Currently message appears on both SNPCoverage and PileupTrack portions, and clicking force load will refresh both tracks at same time

Want feedback most on the message content 'Zoom in to see features, (force load may be slow)', and button message 'force load'. Want to convey that a limit has been reached and pressing the button will temporarily lift the limit and render the track at the current settings, but may fail"

I ended up not needing it, but I liked the idea so I thought I'd propose it in this PR.

This makes our setup have two workspaces (top-level folders that our code is organized into): ""packages"" and ""products"". The plugins, core, and development tools stay in ""packages"", and jbrowse-web, desktop, CLI, website, etc. go into the ""products"" workspace.

I thought this was a nice way of adding a bit more organization to our code. There are other options we could use for naming, e.g. having the ""packages"" workspace be ""plugins"", or using some other name than ""products""."

This does some logic similar to breakpoint split view infers where in the read a particular segment of the split read is by using the clipping.

This means that, for example if there is a giant long read that is split across several chromosomes, it can piece all of that together into a seamless dotplot which is pretty nice

With long reads this can be pretty amazing showing multiple chromosomes stitched together seamlessly

Doing this for linear synteny is would be a good next step. It would involve cloning a lot of the logic here

Note that doing if for linear synteny it would also be cool to have per-base level sequence however there is a limitation there, because that would require redispatching in the general case, or require the user to click on the so called ""primary alignment"" because any other supplementary alignment doesn't store the whole read sequence while the primary alignment does

Note that there are a couple tuned values that make it look better for this example, and could possible look weirder with long refnames (the top left coordinate indictor would not automatically put its endpoint right on the top left corner of the red box, thats a coincidence here)

The code is noticeably using both client coordinates vs offset coordinates, which is not great, maybe there's an easier way. The logic is that we want the operations inside the dotplot grid to be actual pixel offsets in that grid, but we want the tooltip div to be coordinates calculated relative to the whole dotplotview div container.

Things to observe

There is a `cellsWithDerived` which instantiates cells that contain derived functions
Contains a lightweight copy of some VcfFeature processing code for determining the end of a VCF feature


General observation

- The assembly manager stuff is sort of complex with this deep poking with when, as indicated by the code below needed to do two when calls. The second one (checking for assembly.region) was found to be needed if open a tabular view before any LGV usage. Would really like some more simplicity here
- The LGV has to instantiate a displayedRegion before doing a navigation, which is somewhat burdensome here
- This always launches a new view but potentially navigating an existing view would be desirable
- There is a function in the URL which is technically an XSS risk. Storing track configs such as session tracks might also have same thing. Might need a general solution to this

* bugfix: when a user clicks on a track but not on a feature, it calls `onClick` (defined on the track model). (Previously it called `onFeatureClick(undefined)` instead)
* enhancement: when a user right-clicks a feature, it keeps the mouseover shading while the context menu is open so it's easier to see which feature was clicked on
* behavior change: move feature click handlers from FeatureGlyph to the mouseover shading overlay. This way, a user can click on any place on the mouseover overlay to select the feature.
  * This was necessary because in applying the bugfix, it made it so that a user had to click exactly on the svg in a feature to select it, instead of anywhere in its ""layout rectangle""
  * This has a bit of a difficult implication for testing. In jsdom, `element.getBoundingClientRect` always returns `{ bottom: 0, height: 0, left: 0, right: 0, top: 0, width: 0 }`, so the layout stuff that figures out if the mouse is overlapping a feature doesn't really work. I worked around this by manually calling `setFeatureIdUnderMouse()`."

1142,Block level status and track level status,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-08-16T00:34:22Z,2020-08-19T16:45:37Z,2020-08-19T13:13:23Z,"In looking at block level status as in #1136, I concluded that we might need block level and track level status

I tried using block level status only but for example, the first thing that is done is getRefNames for the track, and this is initiated from a block, which then does renameRegionsIfNeeded, which then does a getRefNames guarded by an AbortablePromiseCache, so only one request to getRefNames actually ever goes out for the multiple blocks requesting it. Therefore, in order to properly handle this, it might be that abortable-promise-cache itself needs to handle statusCallback and dispatch the status requests to all waiting requests.

An alternative, presented in this PR, is a little weirder, and implies usage of a trackLevel status and a blockLevel status.

This makes it so that, for example, the BamAdapter is coded to set the track level status by calling statusCallback({ message: ""Downloading index file"", level: 1}) where level 1 implies setting a track level status, and level===0 or level undefined is block level. The BamAdapter therefore sort of needs to ""know"" about what is a track level status to make this work which is sort of awkward.

Note that even this isn't perfect, and points to, a need for super-track-level status too. The alignments track demonstrates this because the SNPCoverage track gets the status for ""Downloading index"" set on it's track but PileupTrack doesn't get it, it would be more ideal if

(a) they both got it from a super track level status
(b) the abortable-promise-cache-with-status was implemented"

1131,Rename menuOptions to menuItems,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-08-13T21:33:13Z,2020-08-14T01:42:50Z,2020-08-13T21:38:39Z,As requested [here](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/1129#issuecomment-673712510). Seems like probably a more intuitive name.
1130,Update some core types,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-08-13T21:09:00Z,2020-08-27T20:56:10Z,2020-08-27T20:56:05Z,"This tries to update some types to make them more flexible to fit the various types of products we might need them for.

* Before, a viewContainer was defined as something with ""addView"" and ""removeView."" However, something like embedded linear view has a single view that is never added or removed. This adds singleViewContainer and multipleViewContainer to try to address that
* A viewModel was defined as having ""id,"" ""hideTrack,"" and ""showTrack."" It's possible that a view might not even have tracks, though, if we really want to stick with the ""anything can be a view"" idea. This updates it so a viewModel is defined as having ""id,"" ""type,"" ""width,"" and ""setWidth."" Also adds a ""trackViewModel"" type so users can cast to that type when they know there will be tracks.

This leads to a bit of weirdness since when a plugin is adding a root menu item, it doesn't know whether or not the eventual session that will be attached to that root model supports adding views or not. For now, plugins still add their ""Add View"" menu items, and then the ""onClick"" of that menu item just notifies if the action isn't supported. Not sure if there is a better way to do that.

1129,Make plugins able to add track context menu items,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-08-13T18:03:26Z,2020-08-24T21:16:32Z,2020-08-24T20:10:16Z,"This adds `additionalContextMenuItemCallbacks` to the blockBasedTrackModel. Plugins can add callbacks which return an array of zero or more menu items. These callbacks are evaluated for each right click, so the context menu items can react to whether or not the right click was on a feature, what type of feature was clicked on, etc. As an example:

```js
export default class SomePlugin extends Plugin {
  name = 'SomePlugin'

  install(pluginManager) {
    // install some stuff
  }

  configure(pluginManager) {
    const session = pluginManager.rootModel?.session
    const tracksAlreadyAddedTo = []
    autorun(() => {
      let views = []
      if (session.views) {
        views = session.views
      } else if (session.view) {
        views = [session.view]
      }

      views.forEach(view => {
        if (view.type === 'LinearGenomeView') {
          const { tracks } = view
          tracks.forEach(track => {
            if (
              track.type === 'VariantTrack' &&
              !tracksAlreadyAddedTo.includes(track.id)
            ) {
              tracksAlreadyAddedTo.push(track.id)
              track.addAdditionalContextMenuItemCallback(
                (feature, track, pluginManager) => {
                  const { session } = pluginManager.rootModel
                  const menuItem = {
                    label: 'Some menu item',
                    icon: SomeIcon,
                    onClick: session => {
                      // do some stuff
                    },
                  }
                  return [menuItem]
                },
              )
            }
          })
        }
      })
    })
  }
}
```

Also includes some fixes/changes:
* When a feature is right-clicked, it keeps the mouseover shading until the context menu closes, so it's easier to tell which feature was righ-clicked on
* Bug fix to make sure onClick and onContextMenu are called when there is a click that is not on a feature (was calling onFeatureClick and onFeatureContextMenu for all clicks before)
* Rename MenuOption to MenuItem, which is probably a clearer name.

This was implemented as a dialog instead of a drawer widget for ease of implementation and if desirable it could be a widget

Uses a types.frozen in the config for the metadata so that basically any amount of nested data could be stored if needed

Fields are rendered similarly to the BaseFeatureDetails but not as extensively. Could be a type of thing where this logic could be unified but it basically serves a purpose as is"
1125,Export SVG,closed,enhancement,,cmdcolin,,,2020-08-13T13:02:18Z,2021-04-27T23:26:39Z,2021-04-27T23:01:21Z,"This already is able to export gene features, wiggle, alignments and snpcoverage

The architecture is that renderers have a exportSVG object in their renderProps, then it will output SVG. The renderers also specify that they have supportsSVG as a class property, and any renderer that does not have this will not try to support rendering to SVG

The linearGenomeView has an exportSvg action that uses renderToStaticMarkup from react-dom to generate SVG

This loops over all tracks, and then each track loops over it's dynamic blocks to generate the exported svg output

I think that this is a good result even if it does not support every single situation yet, but I am open to feedback

Session tracks have an icon or highlight on their track title and in their track labels that show in the LGV or other views.

If not in admin mode:
* add track adds a session track
* only session tracks are deletable
* editing a regular track pops up a modal that says something like ""this track isn't owned by you, do you want to make a copy of it and edit that?"", then forks it into a session track, deactivates the old track in all the views, and activates the new track in all the views in which the old track was active

It looks like the rendering components no longer get ""onMouseDown"" and ""onMouseUp"" events, and only get the ""onMouseMove"" event when the mouse button is not pressed down.

To fix, I give the synteny area a set height now so this doesn't happen

Also, I wanted to have an option to hide the ""No tracks"" message. Sometimes a compact view of just the track ruler is all you need. This status is stored on the session so that it can be refreshed to this view.

(Note that you can see there that the build, linting and formatting failed, but the tests passed. If we want to pursue this I can work on getting everything to pass.)

Also, this PR just defines Workflows for branches when commits are pushed, not for PRs. We could have the same Workflows run on a PR as on a push, or different ones. Also, Workflow pass/fails show up on a PR the same as Travis does for us currently, and they would look something like this:

1099,Combine reference drop-down and location/search box,closed,enhancement,,garrettjstevens,teresam856,teresam856,2020-07-31T20:58:23Z,2020-12-10T20:18:05Z,2020-12-10T20:18:05Z,"Right now in the LGV we have a drop-down box with the refNames in an assembly, and a location box (which will someday also be search box once we have indexing, I think). The drop-down box is not very wide and gets unusable with refNames more than a few characters (see also https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/issues/1084):

I think that using an autocomplete combo box, though, we could combine both the drop-down and the location/search box and still keep all the same functionality. Here's a quick mock-up of what that might look like:

Some details of the behavior would still have to be worked out, and it would be a departure from JBrowse 1, so we'd have to make sure it was worth the change."

You can fix it by adding publicPath to your webpack config, e.g.

```js
config.output.publicPath = 'http://localhost:9000/'

but then that means you have to know where the plugin is going to be hosted when you are building it. I'm not sure if there is a better way. You can also set public path at runtime like 

```js
__webpack_public_path__ = process.env.ASSET_PATH

- Large refname has a text collision

- The locstring box also fails to show the currently displayed region, however this is tricky. The refname is simply long

}
```

**To Reproduce**

1. Execute the following commands in your web root:
```
jbrowse create jbrowse2
cd jbrowse2
jbrowse add-assembly https://v1.legumefederation.org/data/public/Pisum_sativum/Cameor.gnm1.P4FG/pissa.Cameor.gnm1.P4FG.genome_main.fna.gz --name ""Pisum sativum Cameor v1"" --alias pissa.Cameor --type bgzipFasta
jbrowse add-track https://v1.legumefederation.org/data/public/Pisum_sativum/Cameor.gnm1.ann1.7SZR/pissa.Cameor.gnm1.ann1.7SZR.gene_models_main.gff3.gz.csi --name=""Genes"" --trackId=genes --category=""Genes""
```
2. Navigate to http://localhost/jbrowse2.
3. Add a linear Genome View (File > Add > Linear Genome View)
4. Click the ""Select Tracks"" button and enable the ""Genes"" track. It will add the track but the error shown in the above screenshot should be visible instead of the gene glyphs.

NOTE: I'm using a docker image for easy reproducibility. You can access it [here](https://github.com/laceysanderson/jbrowse2play/tree/master/JBrowseUse) including instructions on it's usage. If using the docker, execute the following commands after starting your container rather then those listed in step 1 above.
```
docker exec useJBrowse jbrowse add-assembly https://v1.legumefederation.org/data/public/Pisum_sativum/Cameor.gnm1.P4FG/pissa.Cameor.gnm1.P4FG.genome_main.fna.gz --name ""Pisum sativum Cameor v1"" --alias pissa.Cameor --type bgzipFasta
docker exec useJBrowse jbrowse add-track https://v1.legumefederation.org/data/public/Pisum_sativum/Cameor.gnm1.ann1.7SZR/pissa.Cameor.gnm1.ann1.7SZR.gene_models_main.gff3.gz.csi --name=""Genes"" --trackId=genes --category=""Genes""
```

 I've also tested this on my debian web server with the same results.

**Expected behavior**

I expect to see the gene glyphs since #797 implies CSI is supported for GFF3 files (confirmed by config being correctly added).

**Version:**

Browser: Firefox 77.0.1 and Chrome 83.0.4103.116

```
$ jbrowse --version

**Additional context**

The public example files used are from Pisum sativum (field pea) Cameor and available for usage here: `https://v1.legumefederation.org/data/public/Pisum_sativum/`. I've also tested this with Lentil but those files are not yet public.

There is a large insertion to the left of these, and the code would expand it so that the insertion would cover the range to the right of the insertions, but that would be incorrect

Now one thing that may be worth noting is that insertions are not not plotted from snpcoverage, and already deletions are also not plotted. Indeed

This results in all the workers downloading their main ""*.worker.js"" bundle **in parallel**, at startup, which can easily saturate the user's connection, and results in a long wait for the worker pool to be ready.

If we created the workers lazily, like if `BaseRpcDriver.getWorker` were async, and there was a smarter worker pool object (right now it's just an array), we could create workers on demand, and some of the ones created later could possibly benefit from the HTTP cache of the main worker bundle.

```
downloads and installs the latest Jbrowse 2 release

USAGE
  $ jbrowse create LOCALPATH [VERSION]

ARGUMENTS
  LOCALPATH  Location where JBrowse 2 will be installed
  VERSION    Version of JBrowse to download, defaults to latest

OPTIONS
  -f, --force         Overwrites existing JBrowse 2 installation if present in path
  -h, --help          show CLI help
  -l, --listVersions  Lists out all versions of JBrowse 2
  -u, --url=url       A direct URL to a JBrowse 2 release

EXAMPLES
  $ jbrowse create /path/to/new/installation
  $ jbrowse create /path/to/new/installation --force
  $ jbrowse create /path/to/new/installation -u url.com/directjbrowselink.zip
  $ jbrowse create /path/to/new/installation 0.0.1
  $ jbrowse create -l
```


Current setup is that there is a versions.json file in the jb2_releases s3 bucket that looks like
`{ versions: [0.02, 0.01] }`. When create is run with the path argument, it will take the latest version (0 index in the array) and fetch that version's zip file, i.e https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse.org/jb2_releases/JBrowse2_version_0.0.2.zip, and unzip into the path provided. Users can specify a different version if they want an older version of jb2, or specify a url to download that specfic jbrowse release.

NOTE: It's only 0.0.2 to test that switching between different versions would work and that it could detect the latest version. Can change the array to only have 0.0.1 and have the uploaded release end in 0.0.1

update: 
```
Upgrades JBrowse 2 to latest version

USAGE
  $ jbrowse upgrade [LOCALPATH]

ARGUMENTS
  LOCALPATH  Location where JBrowse 2 is installed

OPTIONS
  -h, --help           show CLI help
  -l, --latestVersion  Displays the latest JBrowse 2 version

EXAMPLES
  $ jbrowse upgrade
  $ jbrowse upgrade /path/to/jbrowse2/installation
  $ jbrowse upgrade -l
```
similar to create but needs to have an existing JBrowse 2 installation to run. Also checks the latest version in same way as create and overwrites the existing JBrowse 2 files. In future, if we have a way of detecting the installed JBrowse 2 version, can check with the latest version in s3 bucket and reject upgrade if they already on the latest version

I tried this out here in this PR but I did have a couple of concerns

1) It is a little unclear of the checking of the symbolic field is really the right behavior here? It seems to work, so as a stop gap it does help this situation
2) It is sort of clear to me that, given that there can be multiple alternative alleles, each alternative allele could have it's own ""END"" field potentially. this is a little weird, and we could consider this maybe a non-issue and say our ""parent variant"" is the maximum range of the individual alternative alleles in it's ""container"""

If there is no top-level `config.json` (which there isn't in our dev builds or a new prod build), it just shows a screen saying JBrowse hasn't been configured yet, and in dev it lists our development configs you can navigate to. For the branch deployment, it copies `test_data/config.json` to `config.json` after building, so our travis-deployed builds will have a default config and the current behavior is preserved.

Here is the documentation auto-generated for this command in the README:

```
USAGE
  $ jbrowse add-assembly SEQUENCE
ARGUMENTS
  SEQUENCE
      sequence file or URL
      If TYPE is indexedFasta or bgzipFasta, the index file defaults to <location>.fai and can be optionally specified
      with --faiLocation
      If TYPE is bgzipFasta, the gzip index file defaults to <location>.gzi and can be optionally specified with
      --gziLocation
OPTIONS
  -a, --alias=alias
      An alias for the assembly name (e.g. ""hg38"" if the name of the assembly is ""GRCh38""); can be specified multiple
      times
  -c, --config=config
      [default: ./config.json] Config file; if the file does not exist, it will be created
  -f, --force
      Equivalent to `--skipCheck --overwrite`
  -h, --help
      show CLI help
  -n, --name=name
      Name of the assembly; if not specified, will be guessed using the sequence file name
  -t, --type=indexedFasta|bgzipFasta|twoBit|chromSizes|custom
      type of sequence, by default inferred from sequence file
      indexedFasta   An index FASTA (e.g. .fa or .fasta) file; can optionally specify --faiLocation
      bgzipFasta     A block-gzipped and indexed FASTA (e.g. .fa.gz or .fasta.gz) file; can optionally specify
      --faiLocation and/or --gziLocation
      twoBit         A twoBit (e.g. .2bit) file
      chromSizes     A chromosome sizes (e.g. .chrom.sizes) file
      custom         Either a JSON file location or inline JSON that defines a custom sequence adapter; must provide
      --name if using inline JSON
  --faiLocation=faiLocation
      [default: <fastaLocation>.fai] FASTA index file or URL
  --gziLocation=gziLocation
      [default: <fastaLocation>.gzi] FASTA gzip index file or URL
  --overwrite
      Overwrite existing assembly if one with the same name exists
  --refNameAliases=refNameAliases
      Reference sequence name aliases file or URL; assumed to be a tab-separated aliases file unless --refNameAliasesType
      is specified
  --refNameAliasesType=aliases|custom
      Type of aliases defined by --refNameAliases; if ""custom"", --refNameAliases is either a JSON file location or inline
      JSON that defines a custom sequence adapter
  --refNameColors=refNameColors
      A comma-separated list of color strings for the reference sequence names; will cycle through colors if there are
      fewer colors than sequences
  --skipCheck
      Don't check whether or not the sequence file or URL exists
EXAMPLES
  $ jbrowse add-assembly GRCh38.fa
  $ jbrowse add-assembly GRCh38.fasta.with.custom.extension.xyz --type indexedFasta
  $ jbrowse add-assembly myFile.fa.gz --name GRCh38 --alias hg38
  $ jbrowse add-assembly GRCh38.2bit --config path/to/config.json
  $ jbrowse add-assembly GRCh38.chrom.sizes
  $ jbrowse add-assembly GRCh38.config.json

This code might be a little hard to test so let's try to keep it a very thin wrapper around the code made in #1027. Mostly just a plain-JS class that looks a little like protein-widget/src/Viewer.js, and a webpack configuration that does a CDN-able UMD build of it.

Make some factory functions that make it easy to make a state tree root model, theme provider, and all the other tooling that a JB2 view needs in order to run. If you find yourself duplicating tons of code from elsewhere, try to refactor the core models to reduce duplication.

```jsx
let model = stateTreeFactory({

  tracks:[ /* array of full track snapshotIn */ ],
  plugins:[ /* optional list of runtime plugins to load */ ],

})
let theme = useDefaultJBrowseTheme()

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <JBrowseLinearGenomeView  model={model}/>
</Theme>
```

This should not spawn any web workers, it will use the main-thread RPC driver. Should not require any webpack worker support.

- create a pluginManager with a set of core plugins that are necessary to make a linear genome view
- create a stateTreeFactory that is ""easy to use""
- pass state tree model to the React component
- fix some small display issues when displaying the LGV in this standalone way"

There are several stages of loading which includes first javascript bundle for the main thread, and then, each worker individually downloading the same ~2.8MB bundle which is actually literally downloading it four times, the resource is not singly downloaded once.

The refName loading on the ImportForm for LGV and in the header bar for the LGV have the same loading pattern using the worker to do a getRefNames. We could make this faster if we made the getRefNames for the assembly did not use the worker, but this may just ""kick the can"" for downloading the worker bundles down the road a bit. It might be warranted if it improves perceived performance though

* category (optional, can be a comma separated string)
* description (optional)

Positional args

* single filename or URL

We will want to consider what to do about file system file paths e.g.

With /path/to/my.bam  we could have options to copy, move, or symlink the file into the data directory

1010,Add longer timeout for jbrowse test,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2020-06-17T17:25:47Z,2020-06-18T17:28:36Z,2020-06-18T01:22:15Z,"Unfortunately the cause of some slowness in #1008 is sort of unclear. There are some patterns I observed

- Using only pako can improve some performance, e.g. remove nodeUnzip
- Using gunzipSync can improve some performance, e.g. change nodeUnzip to use gunzipSync 
- There was another thing where we can sometimes reduce the amount of data we unzip in the BAM header because it by default adds two BGZIP blocks onto the end of the first request (indexData.firstDataLine + 65535 and then again). These added blocks are probably paranoid, and can likely be removed, only unzipping up to firstDataLine which improves some performance
- Other general BAM header and BAI index parsing improvements could be made (the babelization of the BAI parsing seems to result in some inefficient code sometimes, too much abort checking while parsing BAI header, etc)


 All those things could be done, and it could cut down on BAM setup time. For now, it seems like just adding a timeout is helpful though, and if there is any feedback I can go and make some of the other changes here.


This PR also adds node14 to the build matrix

Also, while it seemed to affect that particular test a lot, it's not clear if it particularly affects this test super badly, as any BAM test seems to be affected, it's just this one ended up standing out somehow."

See the added failing test in 2ebe710c2ce7825a117180725298c79ee9ce4fc6.

While looking at the zoomToDisplayedRegions code, I had an idea for a new algorithm for determining where to navigate to. Basically it does this:

- For each displayed region, check if it intersects with any the selection regions
  - If it does, use that region and selection to calculate a start offset and an end offset
  - Only set the start offset once, and update the end offset with each new overlap
- If there were any overlaps, use moveTo to navigate to the offsets (no longer uses navToMultiple)

This change passes all the previously existing tests as well as the one I added that was originally failing.

Also has one small change so that you have to select more than 3 pixels to trigger a navigation (this matches the behavior other rubber band).

One note on the bit of reorganizing I did on the overview rubber band tests, I was trying to separate each case out into its own test. For naming, I used [this suggestion](https://jasmine.github.io/2.6/introduction#section-Grouping_Related_Specs_with_%3Ccode%3Edescribe%3C/code%3E) that the `describe` and `it` parameters when combined should form a sentence."

Here are some of the potential problems/issues I've seen:

- In jbrowse-web, saved sessions are in the config, but the config is not editable by a user.
  - If we move sessions to localStorage, we need some reliable way of saying which session belongs with which config. Would have to use the location of the config in the localStorage key, maybe, but that seems a bit complicated and potentially unstable.
- If you had a session that was too big for a URL, currently the only way to share it is to export it as JSON so someone can re-import it (functionality actually probably broken right now, but could be fixed easily). Same as above, need some reliable way to say what config that session belongs to.
- jbrowse-desktop only has a single config. If jbrowse-web supports multiple configs, do we need to do that in jbrowse-desktop as well?
- There's no way to switch configs in the UI, we just have to ""know"" the right URL and enter it manually.

#### My proposal

I propose we only have a **single config** for jbrowse-web. Here are some of the potential drawbacks of a single config, and how I propose to mitigate them:

- **Environment separation** - Right now we have a small ""production"" human config, a more extensive human config with tracks we use a lot in development, and a volvox development config. I propose having these all in the same config and adding **global** and **session filters**. With these filters a user could include (or exclude) whole assemblies or individual tracks (maybe based on some track metadata). That way we can still only show a subset of the whole data, but still have one config. Note that these filters would just visually filter the assemblies/tracks from things like the assembly selector drop-down or track selector. The assemblies/tracks would still exist and if a session used one of the filtered assemblies/tracks it would still be valid.
- **Sample separation** - Perhaps a researcher only wants to see tracks from a specific sample. Instead of having a separate config for each sample, you would use filtering in your session as described above to filter by sample.
- **Config size** - One concern is that a single config JSON could get too big to be easily worked with. We've already said we want our tracks to be able to have multiple sources, so if we're still committed to that, we could split tracks out into separate JSON file ""sources"" and control the size of the config that way.

Some of the advantages of a single config are:

- Sessions no longer have to be associated with a particular config, so complexity in saving/sharing sessions is reduced
  - Moving saved sessions out of config into localStorage would be easy
- Don't have to worry about UI for config switching
- Don't have to worry about supporting multiple configs in jbrowse-desktop

One other thing I would like to propose is that sessions in jbrowse-web aren't saved automatically, you have to File->Save them manually. If we add a new session in localStorage every time you go to a URL that has a session in it, they'll add up quickly."

It also adds a value before rounding to the nearest 2^n so that it doesn't round to like ""4"" when there are 3 base pairs, it will round to something like 16 which I think for most cases is better

For fractional values it does not apply this adaptive headroom

The difference in sorting implementations means that the features in the test get sorted differently when run in node<11 vs node>=11.

It seems like the biggest challenge in making canvas-based circular views is going to be allowing mouse event handlers to continue to function correctly, for example, to enable clicking on arcs.

990,More options for smooth zooming,closed,"enhancement,needs review",,cmdcolin,,,2020-06-05T18:22:37Z,2020-08-20T20:09:14Z,2020-08-20T20:09:14Z,"This is kind a ""wish list"" item, but I think smooth zoom out with slider or ctrl+wheel would be very cool. The current zoom animation demonstrates that it ""is possible"" to do this, so I am wondering if it could be extended to be user controllable.

Zooming out is sometimes a slow operation, yet zooming in and out on genomic context can be quite useful. Also, jbrowse 1 had a big magnifier to zoom in/out farther which might be useful"

1) Designate PileupTrack to be in control of sorting and showing soft clipping, which was till this sort of dependent on being contained in a AlignmentsTrack (RE: #981 )

I think it is not intuitive that you have to go to the view menu to turn on this option. I know this was something that had some various different arguments during grooming.

My original stance was that the way the feature was ORIGINALLY demo'd, which had a right click that turned the setting on for all tracks in a way that emulated IGV behavior very precisely, was fine. But we then decided that we should make this function, and turn it into a new menu.

* shipping the features, layout, and rendering to the main thread
* deserializing the features, layout, and rendering on the main thread (mostly native code that we don't see)

Adds a `getRefNameColor` to assemblies in the assemblyManager. Can be customized in the assembly config as an array of color strings (which will get cycled through if there are not enough for every refName).

refNames on circular view will darken/lighten the colors if necessary depending on the background to make them readable.

943,Dragging the circular view should rotate it,open,enhancement,,ihh,,,2020-05-20T22:10:36Z,2021-09-17T17:33:01Z,,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

It takes frustratingly long to rotate the circular view by pressing the buttons. Increasing the rotation per button press (as in #942) will help, but at the cost of precision.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Dragging the circular view should rotate it in a direction such that the drag is tangent to the circle at the point where the drag starts. (In other words, clicking at the top and dragging left will rotate it counterclockwise; clicking on the right and dragging down will rotate it clockwise.)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Buttons should also rotate it more #942 but this is JBrowse, it should be draggable.

**Additional context**

The prototype at http://jbrowse.org/u24/rotunda/ is a good example of how it should work.

It takes frustratingly long to rotate the circular view by pressing the buttons.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Each button press should rotate the view by 30 degrees.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Making the view draggable (so it rotates when you drag it) would also be good, but the buttons should be fixed.

**Additional context**

The prototype at http://jbrowse.org/u24/rotunda/ is a good reference for the look-and-feel I'm after.

@peterkxie  found this while working on soft clipping, where not primary alignment aka secondary alignments actually have no feature.get('seq') which is confirmed in SAM. In JBrowse 1 supplementary alignments are actually filtered out but I think this is probably wrong, supplementary alignments are important for SVs for us

An RPC method is now a class that extends `RpcMethodType`, which has an `execute` method that it has to override. It can also optionally override several serialization and deserialization methods to give it control over serializing and deserializing its args and return val across the RPC boundary.

In passing, also
* removed last vestiges of pluggable menu bar types
* slightly simplified RPC/IPC infrastructure of jb desktop
* renames RPC stateGroupIds to just call them sessionIds
* overhauls the way RPC sessionIds are calculated. it now traverses upwards in the tree and takes the `rpcSessionId` of the highest parent that has one. this has the effect of grouping all RPC calls for one piece of the subtree into the same worker.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/81719617-8181c180-943a-11ea-9221-369110abb879.png)

I wanted to know where this suggestion came from since `ts80007` looked like some sort of official TypeScript code. I found a list of diagnostic codes [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/cbf15bb6ed1cd8b30403654a0a1c67baac329d06/src/compiler/diagnosticMessages.json), but couldn't find a setting to get the compiler to export any of the ""suggestion"" level diagnostics programmatically. From what I've been able to tell, these suggestions can only be gotten from the [typescript standalone server](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Standalone-Server-%28tsserver%29), which editors and IDEs can use for various things. So between talks at BoG last week I decided to try and write a script to extract these suggestions. The script is included here and can be run with `node scripts/getSuggestions.js` and writes the suggestions to stdout. A lot of them aren't things we need to fix, but there were quite a few suggestions I thought would be good, so this PR addresses those (and some other things that were related). Here are some highlights:

- Removed some unnecessary `async`s and `await`s
- Removed unused variables
- Removed unused type parameters
- Make documentation [tsdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc)-compliant. There's actually a lint rule for this, too, which I've added.
  - tsdoc looks like it's the ""official"" standard for TypeScript docs, but it's still new so there's not a ton of great tooling for it yet. I mentioned better-docs in the call last week, but I've now realized it doesn't utilize TypeScript typings, so it's probably not what we want. [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) could be another thing to look into, though.
- According to [MST](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/tips/typescript#using-a-mst-type-at-design-time), MST-based types should be created as interfaces and not types, since they are less complex and will not slow down compiling as much. This changes those types, and also moves them in with the rest of the TypeScript types.

Maybe not all of these are worth keeping, so I could drop some of the commits if needed."

NEEDS DISCUSSION: Currently, I have removed the alignments track general context menu (the one with show/hide coverage track and show/hide pileup track). This menu is still accessible in the track menu. This means that a right click inside an alignments track only opens a menu when the cursor is hovered over a feature, or else nothing happens. Should this be the interaction or should the general context menu be brought back whenever user right clicks inside alignments track but not hovering a feature."

900,LGV Overview display and rubber band behavior,closed,,,garrettjstevens,peterkxie,peterkxie,2020-04-23T23:12:41Z,2020-06-15T18:53:03Z,2020-06-15T18:53:03Z,"The LGV overview bar currently shows the whole contig of any displayed regions and highlights the currently visible location. If we want add highlighting of the displayed regions (not just the currently visible regions) and rubber banding, we need to define their behavior, especially with multiple displayed regions.

I think rubber band navigation should not be allowed if there are multiple displayed regions. It's just too hard to decide what the ""right"" place to navigate to is, especially if some of the regions are reversed or overlap. For example, rubber band navigation on the highlighted area of the overview bar below would either have to ask which displayed region you wanted to zoom in to, or just zoom in to an area that still had both displayed regions in it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/80157905-772f7e80-8584-11ea-8216-c5fa15db8995.png)

Highlighting the displayed regions on the overview can also get complicated with multiple displayed regions. Just showing overlapping visible regions is complicated enough, without adding highlighting of displayed regions:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/80158270-5156a980-8585-11ea-8b09-d947222e7105.png)

I think one good option might be that instead of highlighting the individual displayed regions, you could color as ""disabled"" the parts of a contig that are not in any displayed regions."
899,Location box navigation with multiple locstrings,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-04-23T22:31:43Z,2020-05-22T15:45:08Z,2020-05-22T15:45:08Z,"Currently in the LGV, navigation by locstring only works on the current displayed region, and only when there is a single displayed region. (Note, this behavior probably needs to be modified to be like JB1 and allow navigation to a location on any contig in the assembly, see #858, but may be affected by discussion points below). When there are multiple displayed regions, they show up in the location box as semicolon-separated locations, but text entry is disabled.

The behavior for being able to use locstring navigation with multiple locstrings and/or within multiple displayed regions is not yet defined. @rbuels and I discussed a couple options a while back:

### Option 1: Locstrings are for navigation only

- If there is a single displayed region that exactly matches a contig in the assembly:
  - Entering a single location will navigate to that location, updating the displayed region to exactly match the contig of the location if necessary
  - Entering multiple locations is not allowed
- Else (e.g. a single displayed region that is shorter than the whole contig, multiple displayed regions)
  - The location must exactly match a region that exists on the current displayed region(s), or else navigation will fail

This option means that if we want users to be able to create displayed regions from locstrings, there will have to be a separate place in the UI to do that.

### Option 2: Locstrings can create displayed regions

- If there is a single displayed region (whether or not is exactly matches a contig in the assembly):
  - Entering a single location will navigate to that location, updating the displayed region to exactly match the contig of the location if necessary
  - Entering multiple locations will create new displayed regions that match those locations, with the left end of the first displayed region and the right end of the last displayed regions being expanded to the limits of their contig.
    - e.g. entering `chrA:5000..6000;chrB:7000..8000;chrC:9000..10000` would result in three displayed regions: `[{refName: 'chrA', start: 0, end: 6000}, {refName: 'chrB', start: 6999, end: 8000}, {refName: 'chrC', start: 8999, end: 36000}]`, assuming `ctgC` is 36,000 bases long.
- Else (e.g. multiple displayed regions)
  - If the location entered exists on the currently displayed regions, navigate to it, do not create any new displayed regions
  - If the location entered does not exist, behave the same as if there is a single displayed region

This option is not deterministic, since entering the same thing in the location box might navigate in one case and create displayed regions in another case depending on what the current displayed regions are. It also may be confusing to users in some cases why their displayed regions suddenly changed, although it will be undo-able. Also, there's currently no syntax for defining a reversed displayed region via locstring.

---

I favor Option 1, since it seems to me that creating displayed regions should be a separate UI action in a separate place from navigating, and it's less complicated so the behavior is easier to predict for users."

- Would we want the labels full width like this, or the same width as when they are floating over a track?
- Should the labels be resizable?
- What would this option be called? (Maybe have a ""Track labels"" menu with three radio options, ""hidden,"" ""floating,"" and ""above""?)

Also note if implementing this:

- Breakpoint split view will need to be aware of the track label height and position

894,Use SVG instead of font icons,closed,enhancement,,garrettjstevens,,,2020-04-22T20:32:11Z,2020-05-19T01:50:25Z,2020-05-19T01:50:25Z,"Currently for our icons we use the material icon font for our icons. However, Material-UI suggests using SVG fonts whenever possible: https://material-ui.com/components/icons/#font-vs-svg-which-approach-to-use

We originally used font icons because we wanted users to be able to specify menu item icons in config files, which isn't possible with SVG (but with the icon font you could just specify a string).

Now that menus are not in the config, though, that reason no longer holds, so we should perhaps move to using SVG fonts instead. The link above explains some advantages of SVG, but some of the highlights for us might be:

* Smaller: Webpack should only bundle the icons we actually use, instead of the whole icon font.
* Plugins can easily use their own custom icons like this:

```js
<SvgIcon>
  <path d=""M20 12l-1.41-1.41L13 16.17V4h-2v12.17l-5.58-5.59L4 12l8 8 8-8z"" />
</SvgIcon>
```

* No ""loading flicker"" where the font hasn't loaded yet, so the icon doesn't appear properly. Especially noticeable on slower machines/connections. Example:

This  gets rid of the pluggable menu type and makes it so plugins can register menus and menu items on the root model during the `configure` phase. Each plugin is responsible for adding menu items for itself, (e.g. the LGV plugin adds the ""New linear genome view"" menu item to the File menu).

A plugin can read the current menus from `pluginManager.rootModel.menus` and set new menus with `pluginManager.rootModel.setMenus`. There are also several convenience functions for common actions like adding a top-level menu, adding a menu item to a top-level menu, and adding a menu item to a sub-menu.

This also adds the ability for the menus to be nested, and so attempts to simplify the File menu like this:

889,Adds context menu capabilities and sorting pileup track abilities to alignments track,closed,,,peterkxie,,,2020-04-20T19:31:24Z,2020-04-21T20:26:04Z,2020-04-21T19:20:20Z,"This addresses step 2 in #792 to improve alignments track. There are two major feature updates

1. Adds a right-click context menu to alignments track. 

User can right click on the pileup or snp coverage portion to reveal a context menu which allows you to hide one or the other track. I.e hide the snp coverage track so only the pileup track is displayed. Feature specific context menus will be implemented soon so there will eventually be two different context menus depending on where the user right-clicks. The options in the context menu also exist in the track controls menu

2. Adds ability to sort the pileup track using view menu level actions.

The view level menu now parses through all the tracks in the view and looks for track type actions. These actions are added to the view level menu with a subheader of the track type it is tied to. When selecting one of these actions, it will apply to all tracks in the view of the same time. I.e, selecting sort under alignments track in the view menu will sort all alignment tracks in the view

Alignments track now can have it's pileup track sorted by either start location, base pair, or read strand. The sort will alway be done on the center bp. To see what bp is in the center, user can toggle 'show center line' in the view menu that toggles a ui element which outlines and writes out what the center bp is.

To clear a sort, either select 'Clear sort' or refresh the page.

It also has coloring modes for insert size gradients, color by pairs being oriented incorrectly, color by ""abnormal insert size"" discretization (from collecting statistics about insert size)

Mechanisms include ""extending the length that a block fetches"" by a variable called max insert size. This is a configurable variable, to make sure that when a particular block is rendered, that the glyph currently being drawn is fully resolved. Alternative includes drawing only half a feature until you ""come into contact"" with the other, but this I think suffers from inter-block dependencies whereas max insert size just extends each block fetch size

It also now adds two extra steps when setting up the plugin manager. You have to call `createPluggableElements` and optionally `setRootModel` before `configure`. You need to call `setRootModel` if you are using any plugins that need the root model during their `configure` phase (none of ours do yet, but they likely will after #452).

Originally @rbuels and I moved the creation of the plugin manager to index.js, but I ended up factoring it out into Loader.js so that it could be tested. Not sure if there is a better naming/pattern.

This makes `createTestSession` be a bit out of place in rootModel.js, but I also removed the usage of `createTestSession` in many places. `createTestSession` should probably be replaced by something else at some point."

This simplifies things by just measuring the view widths directly and setting them, and not worrying about the whole app width at all. Since it measures the actual view widths, if a view shrinks due to a scroll bar appearing, everything updates accordingly and there isn't a problem with unwanted horizontal scroll bars.

The second commit adds a BaseViewModel for views to compose so they will be sure to have the basic requirements of a view (id, width, optional displayName, optional menuOptions).

- No more track controls, not have a floating track label with a button that opens a track menu
- Container for all views that has close button, optional menu button, and optional editable display name
- Pan buttons in LGV header (with animated pan)
- LocString updates as you navigate around
- Error messages if you try to navigate by a locString and it fails
- Side scrolling works when the mouse is on the scale bar and in the track area when no tracks are open
- Vertical guides in track area
- Rubber band action on scale bar opens a menu instead of automatically zooming
- Cursor guide when hovering over scale bar
- Overview scale bar with polygons that show currently visible region

Here are some things this PR does **not** do, that I feel might be better in separate follow-up PRs:

- Overview just shows currently visible regions. Does not have rubber band navigation yet, and does not show displayedRegions (there are a number of things to consider here that I'd like to lay out in a future PR)
- Animated zoom
- Location box does not allow input when there are multiple displayed regions
- Allow hiding/re-positioning track labels
- Add ""Get sequence"" to scale bar rubber band menu

If any of these things are must-haves for this PR, I can work on them, otherwise I think it would be best to get this bulky part in and iterate from there.

GDCAdapter.ts and GDCFilter.ts are used to create tracks from the GDC API. For now, they support both gene and mutation tracks. The adapter has four configuration fields which are filters, featureType, cases, and size. These can be edited in the configuration editor drawer.

There is also a new GDCFilterConfigurationEditorDrawerWidget which provides an easy way for users to apply filters to their track and also see what filters are currently applied. Any time a filter is added/removed, the track will be updated. Currently, the logic for these filters is that they are combined with an AND operation and the individual filters use an IN operation. In the future, this can be expanded to use more operations, such as NOT IN and OR.

859,Add a cascading menu to Core,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2020-03-18T17:52:35Z,2020-03-19T00:43:39Z,2020-03-19T00:43:34Z,"One thing Material-UI lacks by default is a good cascading menu. There's been an [open issue](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/11723) for it for almost two years, and people have tried various solutions, but I tried many of them and they had limitations. The biggest problem is that most people seem tried to create a NestedMenu component that you could drop in as a replacement for a MenuItem, but each submenu then gets opened in a new modal, which makes it hard to coordinate mouse and keyboard events between the menu and submenu.

I needed a good menu for the track label menu in the LGV polishing, and @peterkxie needs one for his right-click menu, so I decided to make our own and add it to core. You provide an array of menu entries (which can have submenus) to the component and it creates a cascading menu. The submenu opens when you hover your mouse on its parent, and it's fully keyboard navigable. It supports:

- Icons
- Secondary text on labels
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Dividers

This PR also converts the LGV menu and Spreadsheet column menus to using the new menu.

857,"Make each displayed region have ""reversed"" flag",closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2020-03-16T17:53:44Z,2020-04-01T21:54:30Z,2020-04-01T21:53:42Z,"@cmdcolin and I were [chatting on gitter](https://gitter.im/GMOD/jbrowse2?at=5e6c0e4017d3e742347a3a62) about flipping of displayedRegions, which got me thinking about what I felt would be the best way to represent that. The limitation I kept coming up against was that if `horizontallyFlipped` were an attribute of the view, you couldn't have a forward and reverse region in the same view. For example, with breakend W/Y below:

![image](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/raw/8b0a59271f13eea9cff30c6e372b7fe675f815f0/img/all_orientations-400x296.png)

If you want to show a single-LGV view of the breakend, you'd need to do something like:

```
_______________________________________________
-->|--------->|------->|<-------|<---------|<--
321,500    321,600     |     198,900    198,800
```

We've talked about this before, and decided to make flipping per-region in #258. I wanted to see how hard that would be to implement, and it wasn't bad, so I made this PR for it as a proposal.

In this, the `horizontallyFlip()` action on the LGV reverses the order of the displayed regions and flips the `reversed` flag on each region.

The only thing I couldn't get to easily work was the breapoint split view's overlays, since they look a `horizontallyFlipped` in the view and don't have a region to look at because they're getting their data from the features on the screen.

It also adds and autocomplete box for refName to the LGV setup wizard and LGV header. There's a demo assembly that has 200,000 contigs you can try out by going to: http://localhost:3000/?config=test_data/config_many_contigs.json

The autocomplete is a bit sluggish at 200,000 contigs, but I'm not sure if there's much we can do. You can try out a demo of the MUI component at https://codesandbox.io/s/7g677. If you crank up the number of of options on that demo, you can see that it's the component that is having trouble, not our data or implementation in particular.

Up to about 75,000 contigs it does fine. At 200,000 it takes ~3 seconds to open the drop-down box after clicking on it (though once it's open, you can scroll all 200,000 entries just fine, so react-window seems to be doing well at virtualizing). It also takes a couple seconds to fill in the first letter if you try to type into the autocomplete, though subsequent letters are much faster.

I would say this is probably good enough performance for now, since we're not even totally sure how many contigs users are really going need, and then we can explore other ways to do the autocomplete if we feel we need to later."

This implementation doesn't include the chromosome names in the BAI index, so it is actually not really usable for us IMO. I don't think it's a good thing to rely on chromosomes being connected to the index in an array e.g. chr1 is position 0 in array

So we probably want our own BAI index, and also we could create a BAI index on the e.g. first download BAI, then index it and store it in localstorage or similar, then subsequent refreshes use the BAI index. This is good because chrome decides not to cache large BAI files in it's file cache.

While I had my Windows environment going, I tried jbrowse-web in the old Edge browser to see what would happen. With a couple changes, I got it going on the old Edge (except for Canvas-based tracks, and the layout was a bit off), and it looks like these changes will be relevant to Safari, too.

(Also note, I had to use the production build to get it to work on the old Edge, since our development build just targets Chrome)

* Use [`fastestsmallesttextencoderdecoder`](https://github.com/anonyco/FastestSmallestTextEncoderDecoder) instead of `text-encoding-polyfill`. `text-encoding-polyfill` is the same as `text-encoding`, which is deprecated and no longer maintained. I tried `fast-text-encoding`, but it doesn't support the `fatal` option for `TextDecoder`, which we use.
  * Instead of importing the polyfill in the plugins, just assume it exists and polyfill it in jbrowse-web or tests as needed.
* Polyfill `requestIdleCallback`
* Check for `OffscreenCanvas` during startup of jbrowse-web, and no longer throw an error when it's not found in `offscreenCanvasPonyfill.js`. Checking for `window.chrome` doesn't work, since apparently the old Edge has a `window.chrome`. For now we just assume if it has `OffscreenCanvas`, it has the other things we need. We can add more detailed feature sniffing later."

Now they properly look for it as a dep of the `react-scripts` package, as well as giving the instances of the plugins a unique name just in case.

I also upgraded all our deps, which was mostly uneventful, except the most recent versions of material-ui which made it have to update a couple tests slightly and update some snapshots. Also looks like a few `prettier` rules updated, too, and changed a few things.

* improves the machinery around column types, adding 4 new column types for feature locations (LocString, LocRef, LocStart, and LocEnd), and makes LocString columns be links that will open a new genome view
* adds some basic auto-detection of column data types (Text, Number, LocString) during CSV/TSV import


So now you can make filters on each column, and the SV inspector will show features if your CSV or TSV has 2 locstrings or 2 sets of ref/start/end, and importing will do some limited type detection.

- Connections can no longer provide reference sequences for datasets. It was unused, complicated, and probably didn't actually work correctly. We'll add back in the ability to add assembly sequences from certain types of sources (like JBrowse 1) later as part of dataset management.
- If the JBrowse 1 track is recognized as valid, it just flags it as unsupported and moves on instead of erroring out
- JBrowse 1 store classes are used to guess the JBrowse 2 track and adapters, and if the store class isn't recognized it falls back to guessing based on the `urlTemplate` filename
- When falling back to `urlTemplate` filename, it now recognizes the `.bgz` file extension for block-gzipped files

It's now possible to specify an option in a config schema to define an identifier. The options that do that are `explicitIdentifier` and `implicitIdentifier` (mutually exclusive). With `explicitIdentifier`, the config snapshot must have an identifier. With `implicitIdentifier`, an identifier will be generated if the config snapshot doesn't have one (similar to the old `configId` behavior). If you specify something like `{ explicitIdentifier: 'trackId' }`, then the name of the identifier will be `trackId`, otherwise if you just put `{ explicitIdentifier: true }`, the name of the identifier will be `id`. `implicitIdentifier` isn't currently used, and we may remove it in the future if it turns out there's no need for it.

Currently track and connection configs are the only things that define ids (`trackId` and `connectionId`, respectively). There were some usages of adapter ids, but they weren't used as MST references, just as ways to keep track of adapters. These have been replaced by keeping track of the adapter by `json-stable-stringify`ing its contents (dataAdapterCache.js already did this).

A few small notes:

- There are some things commented out in a couple of the connections that are due for proper removal as part of of addressing #513. I didn't want to get them working with this change just to get rid of them.
- We started removing configuration from views a while back, and this fully removes them. None of the views had any configuration defined, anyway.
- I re-created all our config files by loading them and then re-exporting them, so they should now match exactly what our MST snapshots look like. I deleted a few configs that appear to be unused, but can re-create and update them if someone needs them. Deleted files:
  - test_data/config_circular_test.json
  - test_data/config_human_circular.json
  - test_data/config_integration_test_displayed_region_list.json

The files are loaded as bigChain files, and the literal feature names are the same across both bigChain files allowing simple connectivity to be made.

If it ends up that we do not want to use literal tracks to plot this data, then we will need to create a system similar to a track since this code uses layoutFeatures and such

The idea that you open ""tracks on each view"" is similar to how breakpoint split view works, but it's possible that a new machinery would make this more usable

After starting up the alpha release (JBrowse+2-2.0.0-beta.0-mac-2.zip) and clicking on one of the options for a new session, I got  this dialog box:

To allow thumbnails, users can open the ""Security & Privacy"" option in the System Preferences and then the Privacy tab.  Select ""Screen Recording"" in the left panel and check JBrowse 2 in the right panel and authenticate if necessary.

724,Make breakpoint split view/synteny view tolerant of having multiple refNames in single row,closed,bug,,cmdcolin,,,2019-12-07T19:22:49Z,2019-12-11T21:00:06Z,2019-12-11T21:00:05Z,"Currently there is a raw bpToPx that takes a genome coordinate and turns it into a pixel offset for drawing the squiggles/polygons

This is only working for when there is a single refName

When there are multiple refNames, it actually has to look at the displayedRegion list, find where it is in there, and get the offset

The kicker is that this requires refname-renaming-tolerant lookup of the feature's refName to the canonical refName in the displayedRegions. The LinearGenomeView.bpToPx can do this operation but it does not handle renamed refNames.

Also, this step is could be kind of slow  if it is not implemented carefully, so I would worry about making bpToPx just do a getCanonicalRefName


Options for this include

a) Attaching ""canonical refName"" (e.g. the one from the reference genome) to all features, or making refName equal to the ""canonical refName"" in all cases
b) Making getCanonicalRefName fast and not async

** drawer position not updating when the window is resized to be small
** the top menu bar could be scrolled out of view, we don't want that

* adds a little div container for top-level views, and calls the [scrollIntoView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) method on it to scroll the new view to be visible

a) block boundaries are unnecessarily large when you are zoomed very far out
b) the large amount of data may not lend itself well to svg, however with canvas you get into some difficulties with hit testing
c) if we just render it as a single block instead of with block boundaries, still needs some ability to zoom in

d) The choice of which dataset to add the tracks to
e) Add method to data adapters to validate their configuration ""is this a valid configuration""
f) A new ""file type driver"" method for the data adapters that registers how its configuration is loaded, see e.g. jbrowse 1 CRAMDriver.js and similar

For instance, touching the file/URL toggle in the config editor for a track that is a local file makes the track instantly lose it's filehandle and go away with a 404 error, and this is then it gets saved to the config file essentially making the handle become lost.

Here is a screenshot of changing the refseq volvox.2bit file accidentally, and then the entire app becomes un-reloadable (that is sort of a separate issue of our error handling, but a case in point). I might, for this case, make ""are you sure?"" dialogs or undos...perhaps the config editors in general need more undo functions"

I think it is an issue that users could have trouble with.

To remedy, I think that we should have an ""Add track"" and ""Add connection"" thing in the global menu bar. We already ask what dataset to add a track to anyways, so there is not necessarily anything special about activating it from inside the linear genome view.

The calls to The Track Hub Registry API still use `fetch`, but that's because they need to set headers, query params, etc., and we don't have to worry about CORS for the API.

This also updates the code a bit since it looks like the API returns track hub info in a bit different format now. Unfortunately, the API version number doesn't look like it was changed. Since we can't guarantee the stability, once we have a good way of separating core and non-core plugins this plugin should probably not be in core anymore.

With this change, 23 of the 26 GRCh37 hubs in The Track Hub Registry look to be usable on desktop. The ones that don't work now are e.g. 404 errors when trying to fetch.

r003 0 ref 9 30 5S6M * 0 0 GCCTAAGCTAA * SA:Z:ref,29,-,6H5M,17,0;
r003 2064 ref 29 17 6H5M * 0 0 TAGGC * SA:Z:ref,9,+,5S6M,30,1;


We know that r003 is the same QNAME for both reads, and the BAM flag 2048 indicates supplementary/chimeric alignment on the second read. The second read also has 16 (read reverse complemented) on it, so the sequence is actually reverseComplement(TAGGC)==GCCTA. You can see that the first read has the first 5 bases soft clipped, which are the bases in second read

In any case, with a supplementary alignment, the read could be fragmented into many small pieces, and the way the data is organized does not make it easy to reconstruct necessarily the ""order"" that the records came from in the original ""read template"".

The way to reconstruct this order would be to literally string find the sequence, or the reverse complemented sequence of any supplementary read inside the sequence of the primary read. So that means, any usage of supplementary reads reconstruction needs redispatching to get the primary alignment (which requires getting actually all of the alignments in the SA tag list, since it doesn't tell you which is primary) and then doing string match


One further complication is that, if our ""split view"" does not contain all the fragments of a supplementary alignment, then connecting the fragments ""end-to-end"" is a bit dubious, but maybe this could be indicated with modified lines perhaps"
520,Electron build of JBrowse desktop,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2019-09-24T20:15:17Z,2019-11-21T02:52:08Z,2019-10-30T22:54:25Z,"This started out as a bit of a crazy idea, but now I kind of hope it works out. Basically this makes a new create-react-app (CRA) app for jbrowse-sv-inspector-desktop and builds it in electron. The development version works fine, and I'm working on getting it to build a production version.

As I was working on getting a new electron project going, I tried to start from scratch, but there were so many webpack, babel, etc. things to set up. There are some boilerplates out there, but none of them were great. Really, nothing as nice as what CRA put in place for us in jbrowse-web.

Then I found [this](https://www.codementor.io/randyfindley/how-to-build-an-electron-app-using-create-react-app-and-electron-builder-ss1k0sfer) article on creating an electron app using CRA. It's not exactly what we want, but has some good ideas and gave me a good starting point. Currently you can try out `yarn start` in jbrowse-sv-inspector-desktop and it runs basically a copy of jbrowse-web in an electron window.

Things still to see:

* Can we get good cross-platform builds out of this? (The article above uses electron-builder, which I'm experimenting with now)
* Can we integrate the electron-specific features we want (file system access, etc.) in a safe way using this?

This article above also uses something called [rescripts](https://github.com/harrysolovay/rescripts), which lets you hack your CRA setup without ejecting. I actually used it to un-eject jbrowse-web, so that both it and jbrowse-sv-inspector-desktop can take advantage of the latest CRA updates and we don't have to maintain the dev and build systems separately.

501,Make changing height from config editor work,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-09-17T14:39:35Z,2019-09-20T17:48:36Z,2019-09-20T17:10:16Z,"This fixes the problem where changing height in the config editor didn't update the layout, so features would just get taller and overlap each other. It has two parts: 1) Put the renderer config in the renderProps so that changing the height triggers a re-render 2) Update GranularRectLayout so that it doesn't use its cached rectangles during `addRect` if the cached rectangle has a different height.

This is a draft because while this solution works, I still don't like it. First of all, I don't like sticking the entire renderer config in the renderProps, since a re-render will be triggered on any config change, even where it's not needed (like updating the color). However, I don't want to only add the height config to the renderProps since a re-render should also be triggered on a change of fontSize, alignmentHeight, and possible=y other (maybe not implemented yet) configs.

The other thing I worry about is my solution for the GranularRectLayout. The order that rects get added with `addRect` matters, right? Right now this solution saves the order the rects were added (`this.rectangles` is a Map now instead of an object) so it can re-add them to the bitmap after the bitmap is cleared. The bitmap is cleared any time a height change in a rect is detected. It also only re-adds the rects before the changed rect since it assumes any later rects will have `addRect` called on them after (assuming order matters) and drops the rest of the cache after the changed. I think this works, but I also might be misunderstanding parts of GranularRectLayout. It's possible we could also just dump the GranularRectLayout and make a new one when a height is changed, but I'd have to figure out where in the code that would go.

496,"make ""relationships"" config slot type, add to base track configs",closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-09-11T22:46:52Z,2019-10-31T01:49:18Z,2019-10-31T01:49:18Z,"Add a ""configRelationships"" config slot type that stores as array of 2-element arrays like `[ relationship: string, configId: string]`

Config slot specification would look like:
```js
{
   type: 'configRelationships',
   targetConfigType: 'track',
}
```

And the config slot's MST model would be constructed as:
```
types.model({
  relationships: types.array(
    types.model('Relationship', {
        type: types.string,
        target: types.reference(pluginManager.pluggableConfigSchemaType(targetConfigType)),
     })
  )
})
```

and the snapshot would look like e.g.:
```js
[
{ type: 'derivedFrom', target: 'asdfiaiw2234231'},
//...
]
```

And we can use this for example to give us the ability to click on a circos chord and have it pop-up an auto-populated split view with evidence.

Also add a `trackRelationships` config slot to the base configurations for linear genome tracks and chord tracks respectively.

495,Restore native scrolls,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-09-11T19:53:29Z,2019-09-11T20:40:33Z,2019-09-11T20:40:30Z,"Several months ago before our first alpha I had some panic about the scroll handlers. The issue was that I was seeing issue #437 and I tried to address it with #439

I am not able to reproduce #437 on my current computer when testing commits from d01504816256a9a55fbee3169a3e19a16fdc4783 aug 1 for example (e.g. before #439 was merged)

I can only reproduce #437 on my current computer if I delete overflowX: 'hidden'

489,SPARQL adapter,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2019-09-05T06:24:59Z,2019-09-13T18:31:00Z,2019-09-13T18:30:35Z,"Still a draft since it needs tests and docs.

Based on [JBrowse1 SPARQL](http://jbrowse.org/docs/sparql.html).

SPARQL adapter will replace {start}, {end}, and {refName} in a SPARQL query string stored in `queryTemplate` in the config. Can also configure `additionalQueryParams` in case the query needs to include something like `format=JSON`.

To enable refName aliasing, provide a query in `refNamesQueryTemplate` that provides a ?refName column that has all of the refNames.

Also incorporates ideas from TogoGenome's custom JBrowse1 SPARQL implementation. Basically the problem they were solving is that it's often hard to write a query that has parent and subfeatures on different rows, so it's hard to use the parentUniqueID in JB1. More often each row will have the parent and subfeatures in the same line. This PR adds functionality so that any column that starts with ?sub_ will define a subfeature from that data (and ?sub_sub_ will define a subsubfeature, etc.). Any features that are duplicated across lines will get collapsed. A sample track is included that uses this pattern to make genes with subfeatures from the TogoGenome SPARQL endpont.

It solved problems with actual paired read rendering by not fetching the features beyond a certain TLEN/insert size distance.

Problems that maxInsertSize solved included

1) scrolling to the right causing pairs to appears on the left requires re-rendering the layout completely, so we will need a way to trigger a relayout/rerender if we are allowing arbitrary insert sizes
2) arbitrary insert sizes can end up downloading a lot of data, need to be careful with this
3) the arc track did not require any refetching of the pairs so it solved this elegantly, only the true paired read glyphs required full refetching using the viewAsPairs parameter to bam-js

- Replace `classnames` package with `clsx`. It's a drop-in replacement, and it is already being installed anyway since material-ui has it as a dep.
- Convert a bunch of `withStyles` HOCs to `makeStyles` hooks. Makes code a bit cleaner, and allows for IntelliSense when doing styling:

- Factor all the resize handles (LGV track, circular view, filtering track controls, drawer) into a common ResizeHandle component.
- Get rid of `mobx-react-lite`, since the latest version of `mobx-react` works for hook-based components.
- Import things from material-ui as e.g. `import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper'` instead of `import { Paper } from '@material-ui/core'`. This can help keep bundle size down (https://material-ui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/), although it's perhaps defeated by importing all of `@materail-ui/core` in `ReExports.js`."

443,Use SVG node attributes to wait for style change,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-08-05T23:30:58Z,2019-08-22T03:09:39Z,2019-08-07T17:20:55Z,"As I was working on some testing stuff, I happened across this idea for removing the timeout in JBrowse.test.js. From the commit message:

It does these things

* restores ability to horizontally flip the view
* has a vertical ... menu format
* allows itself to show/hide the header
* has ability to view the entire set of displayed regions from a zoomed-out point of view

Some of my proposed features including locstring input and refseq name dropdown are in some sense very problematic with our arbitrary notion of displayed regions. Therefore, these features may have to be removed, or linked to only show when the displayedRegions are tied to the assembly.

441,Fix scrolling the App pane,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-08-04T00:49:50Z,2019-08-06T16:19:04Z,2019-08-04T02:09:05Z,"This addresses #440 

Some app notes:

The preventDefault at the lower level appears to prevent scrolling at all levels

You can see this in a basic html script like this where scrolling in the inner div, which preventDefault's the wheel event, makes it so the outer one does not scroll (I think this is basically equivalent circumstances

```
<html>
	<body>
		<div id=""out"" style=""background:green;width:200px;height:200px;padding:10px;overflow:auto"">
			<div id=""in"" style=""background:red;width:100px;height:500px;padding:10px;"">
			</div>
		</div>
		<script>

		document.getElementById('out').addEventListener('wheel', function(event) {
			console.log('outer')
		}, {passive:false})

		document.getElementById('in').addEventListener('wheel', function(event) {
			console.log('in')
			event.preventDefault()
		},{passive:false})

		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

The unfortunate aspect of this is that we have to manually scroll both the track and the app vertically. 

Note: most of the problems here can be sort of seen as coming back to this idea that the TrackRenderingContainer is horizontally scrollable but it just has overflowX: 'hidden'. It is difficult to disable scrolling without preventDefault but when that happens all vertical scrolling stops. 

This also addresses an unaddressed problem of #439 which was that if you did scrolling outside the track e.g. in the blank areas before or after a chromosome it could trigger horizontal scrolls that caused #437 so I moved the wheel listener to TrackRenderingContainer"

We preventDefault on all wheel events, which prevents all wheel events that originate over a track from getting to the App view

The menus seem like configuration
The individual state of all drawers are maybe something that can be reduced
The block states on the view can be removed I think as volatile, I think that this was discussed at one point
The alignment feature details are somewhat debatable because if we want to refresh on a feature, you have to re-find the feature in a feature query, but you can easily imagine if you sent a long read feature over a link it would be too long"

After doing a bunch of digging, I've found out that even though we're using `afterEach(cleanup)`, some of the tests are affecting other tests, so they're not isolated from each other. One concrete example is the menus. When you click on a menu title in the menu bar, such as ""HELP"", it opens the menu. The implementation of the menu in material-ui ends up using `ReactDOM.createPortal(menuStuff, document.body)`, which adds the menu to `document.body` at _the same level_ as the app, so it looks like:

```html
<body>
  <div>
    app stuff...
  </ div>
  <div>
    menu stuff...
  </ div>
</body>
```

`afterEach(cleanup)` then only cleans up the original `div` and not the new menu `div`. Also, since the only way to search for things in the menu is to search the whole body (since they're all at the root level), different tests that use then menus could end up finding things in menu `div`s that they didn't create.

We could try to work around this problem (maybe find some way to not use Popper from material-ui), but I get the feeling that this isn't the only cross-test contamination that's happening. It's just the first concrete example I was able to find. So, I think we need to run each integration test in isolation.

I've tried things like creating a new JSDOM document for each test, but can't find a way to have each test in the same file have a different global `document`. Thus to truly isolate the tests we may have to put each integration test in its own file."
430,Save and load sessions,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-07-30T15:24:00Z,2019-08-06T15:34:39Z,2019-08-06T15:34:12Z,"The first change is that the config file no longer has ""session"" and ""sessionSnapshots"". It just has ""savedSessions"" and optionally ""activeSession"", which is just the name of one of the sessionSnapshots. The actual active session is stored separately. It looks like this:

```
        ┌───────sessionModel (the UI state)
rootModel
        └───────jbrowseModel (the config, basically)
```

Here is how things get loaded:

- Checks for a saved config in localStorage
  - If none in localStorage, uses the one in the React props
- Creates model with config
- Checks for a session in the URL
  - Can be either the name of one of the ""savedSessions"" or a whole encoded session
  - If none in URL, checks localStorage
  - If also none in localStorage, uses the first entry in ""savedSessions""
  - If none in ""savedSessions"" uses ""defaultSession"" (which can be in the config, but has a default of just a name and menu bar if there isn't one in the config)
- Loads session
- URL gets updated with encoded session every 3 seconds
- Config and session get written to localStorage every 3 seconds
- Any updates to the currently active session get automatically written to the corresponding ""savedSession"" in the config

Using the Google Docs paradigm, here are the UI actions this enables:

* File -> New Session opens a ""defaultSession"" (appends the date and time to the default session name for uniqueness)
* File -> Open Session... opens a drawer widget where you can see saved sessions and click on one to open it
* File -> Duplicate Session makes a copy of the current session and names it the session name with "" (copy)"" appended
* Session name is editable from the menu bar

I was worried some of these things wouldn't work with undo/redo, so I looked into it and it was actually pretty simple to add undo/redo, so I just did it. It's pretty raw, but but basically works. Also, my worries were unfounded, undo/redo seems to work fine with these changes.

It adds ellipses for textWidths that are very long instead of trying to pack it into the a small range constrained by textWidth. It also removes the usage of textWidth so that it always keeps the natural text layout

It keeps the estimator of fontWidth*55 (we saw in the thread #381 that this can overestimate which is why the text looked weird)

I added a test track with a test for the ellipses with an integration test

Aside: I looked a little bit into what might be possible with measuring the text but the interplay with the layout means that it would have to calculate things like this up front instead and we couldn't really use things like this https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-can-i-measure-a-dom-node afaik since we'd have to do that, then send that back to the layout via a callback, and then it would have to re-render which would definitely induce a double render (whereas that method might not)

This is something I ran into in the session branch I threw away, so I've pulled in things here that I tried. Basically, ""session"" is called in the code a lot, and for us to be able to easily combine JBrowse2 components into different products and to support plugins, we need to say what a session can do. I made some changes to consolidate the session actions a bit. With these changes, all the actions or views on the session are (this doesn't include stuff in e.g. the ui/ dir of jbrowse-web, it only applies to plugins):
```
display()
hide()
displayed
select()
selection
configuration
datasets
connections
makeConnection()
breakConnection()
pluginManager
rpcManager

// and optionally
assemblyData
```

Looking at this list, the connections and datasets likely should be replaced by something more generic, but I'm not sure what yet.

Also, after these changes, it was pretty easy to get the protein-widget working again since I knew what actions/views the root MST model needed.

Another thing we probably need is some mock session in core/ for testing that has the minimum session pieces mocked out so that plugins can stop importing `createTestEnv` from jbrowse-web."

401,Modify how SimpleFeature.fromJSON is called to fix NCList features,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-07-15T15:22:51Z,2019-07-24T01:02:39Z,2019-07-15T22:10:02Z,"This modifies how SimpleFeature.fromJSON is called, which helps fix issues we were seeing in #396 

The features being received are raw objects that contain a uniqueId

SimpleFeature actually expects the uniqueId to be inside of {data:{uniqueId:..., ...}} though

By placing the fromJSON call to expect the data to be in a ""data"" property the code works again. It reduces confusion about when a feature actually has an ""id"" as in column 9 of GFF

This also says that we do not display a feature name as feature.id(), since this is often autocomputed. We only display an ""id"" if it is from feature.get('id')"

395,Move event handlers to linear genome view and allow vertical scrolling,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-07-10T22:00:19Z,2019-07-12T18:04:52Z,2019-07-12T18:02:25Z,"This addresses #142 by just allowing vertical scrolling on individual tracks. This specific change is actually a smaller part of this PR

The main action of this PR is to move the event handlers from the track to the LGV. It also moves the Rubberbanding logic directly into the LGV also.

I felt that the existing ""Rubberband"" component that existed was containing the logic that could be used to implement a highlight, so I made it so Rubberband was just a stateful instance of a highlight in the LGV

The logic of the linear genome view ends up looking a bit more complicated after this but I think it puts the logic for things like scrolling and rubberband zoom in the right location, that could be modularized out as a hook behavior if there is a need

Other notes, the scroll deltaX should be sufficient and we shouldn't need to check other types of deltas on the event as React should have smoothed over this event for us already.
Also the performance concern mentioned in gitter shouldn't be an issue anymore. I was seeing some slower behavior with the devtools open, but it is gone when devtools is closed"

Let's make a first-class view (same screen real estate as an LGV or a circular view) that focuses on a specific variant call to examine the evidence for it and visualize it in different ways to understand it.

A ""variant"" in this case is a group of breakends (grouped by EVENT, PARID, and/or MATEID), or an insertion, a deletion, or even a SNP.

It would have some basic details about the variant in it, such as the name, number of breakends, insertion length if it's an insertion, etc.

And then it would have buttons along the top to spawn different views of the variant.  Show it in a linear view, in a whole-genome circular view, etc.

For an insertion, it would be nice to open a special view with a gapped reference to see the insertion in context.

This requires unpolyfilled requestIdleCallback due to the shim library not passing the options to the global.requestIdleCallback (see https://github.com/santiagogil/request-idle-callback/issues/2)

If a polyfill is strongly needed for a particular browser we can find a workaround.

I also removed the nested requestIdleCallback because I wasn't sure if it was aiding smoothness, but I could restore. Also, more speculative outside-the-viewport data rendering could make it perceived as smoother since the content would just be ready before you arrive there via scrolling"

Then it wires up rpc calls to freeResources for the renderer (which performs discardRange) and the data adapters



It also performs serialize region to only send features relevant to a region to the client for things like pileup renderer (see #229). The logic here is that instead of not sending the layout, we just try to optimize the layout that is sent, because not sending the layout could incur some trouble (e.g. makes mouseovers more difficult or similar)

Feel free to test this out and let me know how it works"

Probably the best way is to configure the layout with a certain max height, and have it return undefined from `addRect` if that is reached. Then the pileup renderer can tell the front end that the max height is reached, and the frontend track can draw a little indicator to notify the user that it's deeper than what can be laid out."

This isn't critical but it looks better way better if the blocks load on demand during scroll, otherwise it just is a white unfilled block as you scroll slowly sideways that gets filled in only when you stop

Other tracks such as the reference sequence track and svgfeatures appear to work in this scenario

I think it can be aesthetically appealing  to have the line rendering in some circumstances (especially in multixyplot but also single too)

I have made it so that it draws a flat line across the feature. Across block boundaries there can be some slight disconnects but looking at a couple tracks doesn't look too bad.

Possibly, if we don't like the ""blockiness"" of the data displayed here, it would be possible to create some  smoothing function, but it can be hard to make that smoothing sync up across block boundaries

Note:   it is a little cumbersome to add a new renderer currently. It would be nice if WiggleTrack automatically knew about the renderers it could use

package-name/

└── src
    ├── index.js
    ├── index.test.js
    ├── PluggableElementOne

        ├── index.js
        ├── model.js
        └── components
            └── PluggableElementTwo.js
```

Each pluggable element has its own directory (although many of the individual pluggable elements pull code from others in the same package). The pluggable element exports its model, configSchema, React component, etc., and the main package index.js imports all this and creates the plugin class.

The plugins I haven't done so far are BigBedAdapter, FilteringTrack, FromConfigAdapter, LollipopRenderer, MainMenuBar, ProteinReferenceSequenceRenderer, SvgFeatureRenderer. My instinct is to just move everything out into packages since it will probably all get re-bundled into jbrowse-image, jbrowse-lite, etc. If anyone thinks anything anything should stay just in jbrowse-web, let me know.

351,Proposed updates to VCF Feature,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-06-12T15:30:31Z,2019-06-20T16:05:55Z,2019-06-13T21:27:20Z,"When I re-did JB1's VcfFeature after the create of vcf-js, I had to keep a lot of things compatible with the old VCF features. Since we're not bound by that in JB2, I'd like to propose some changes:

- Just assume what's in `get()` is the correct case, don't mess with `toLowerCase()` at all.
- Get rid of references to ""genotypes"", since really it's actually sample-specific data that can contain a lot more than just genotypes
- Just have `get()` access the variant information as-is. Only store in `data` things that are derived from the variant info (like SO terms).
- Don't copy INFO fields into `data`. This has the danger of overriding other fields and I think can be a bit confusing.

Here's what's available via `get()`:
```js
console.log(feature.tags())
// [""refName"", ""start"", ""end"", ""description"", ""type"", ""name"", ""aliases"", ""CHROM"", ""POS"", ""ID"", ""REF"", ""ALT"", ""QUAL"", ""FILTER"", ""INFO"", ""samples"", ""SAMPLES""]
```
(I aliased ""samples"" to ""SAMPLES"" since ""SAMPLES"" isn't actually a VCF field like ""ALT"", ""QUAL"", etc. are.)

This makes it so metadata like ""description"" aren't in the feature data itself, but they can still be easily accessed by doing e.g. `feature.parser.getMetadata('INFO', 'DP')`

Hopefully these changes make the relationship between the feature and the underlying VCF data more clear. Thoughts?"

I know Rob had this idea and he and I have talked about this, but what if we got rid of Babel on our data access modules (bam-js, bbi-js, vcf-js, etc.)? We would just write them in pure Node (might need Node 10+ for some modules), and if someone wants to use them on the web, they just need to make sure their webpack is set up to handle it.

This would hopefully simplify maintaining the data access modules since we wouldn't have to deal with Babel runtime stuff, etc. It would hopefully make them function better as generic libraries, too.

A big argument against this is not being able to use TypeScript.

One other thing, I know some of our modules build a webpack bundle so people can use them in the web without having their own webpack toolchain. Do we want to make that consistent across our modules, or just on a case-by-case basis?

## Implementation Notes

* Use `X-*` request headers as the primary way of communicating side-band stuff like analytics.
* Security strategy
  * File type whitelist, validated by magic number (note that `##gff-version 3` is a magic number, so is `##fileformat=VCF...`) or other deeper data validation if file has no magic number (e.g. fai)
* QoS/rate limiting/usage limiting
  * throttle all clients to 1MB/sec
  * limit range request sizes to 50MB
* Need to make some cost estimates
  * outbound data transfer from AWS is 8-10 cents per GB
  * EBS is 10 cents per month of provisioned storage
  * inbound data transfer is free
  * compute resources should be mild
  * 2 cents per GB transfer S3->proxy


## Architecture

### Version 1 (the stupid thing/MVP)

* EC2 server running a node daemon deployed with pm2, not even caching things, just directly proxying each request, and applying the security logic.
* Not even rate limiting right now
* Not even caching things to the filesystem

### Version 2 (the scalable thing)

* keep file chunks in S3, fronted by Cloudfront.  Cloudfront understands HTTP range requests.
* keep a chunk index in DynamoDB
* when a browser requests something, give them a JSON REST response giving them one or more URLs and ranges that they can fetch to get their data
* when filling the cache, record that the chunk is being filled in the database, and download the chunk from the original destination and put it in S3, then record the chunk in the database
* maybe do the fill in-band, or maybe have a separate worker daemon that queries the DB for chunk fill requests and processes them
* also does rate limiting/QoS
* still does the same security logic
* need an evictor process as well that evicts expired stuff from the cache

## API draft

### GET /v1/{url}

Returns data exactly as if the browser had requested that file from the given URL. The url does not even have to be escaped additionally at all, `https://jbrow.se/proxy/v1/http://terrible.org/some/file/someplace.bw` is valid."

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for jbrowse-components :muscle:

🔒 Greenkeeper has found a `yarn.lock` file in this repository. Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.

**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.



📦 📦  Greenkeeper has detected multiple `package.json` files. Since this repo already has a `greenkeeper.json` config file with defined groups, Greenkeeper has only checked whether they’re still valid. 

---
<details>
<summary>💥 Tests on this branch are failing. Here’s how to proceed.</summary>

To solve the issue, first find out which of the dependency’s updates is causing the problem. Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Then push your changes to this branch and merge it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>🏷 How to check the status of this repository</summary>

Greenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.

This is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/GMOD/jbrowse-components.svg)
</details>
<details>
<summary>🏗 How to configure Travis CI</summary>

Greenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated. Travis CI will run your tests on these branches automatically to see if they still pass.

No additional setup is required 😊

</details>
<details>
<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

To make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # Change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch --all
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # Adapt your code until everything works again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components.git greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>

After you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

The above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

However, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.

This way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

This means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.

These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:

To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.

To enable Greenkeeper, you need to make sure that a [commit status](https://help.github.com/articles/about-statuses/) is reported on all branches. This is required by Greenkeeper because it uses your CI build statuses to figure out when to notify you about breaking changes.

Since we didn’t receive a CI status on the [`greenkeeper/initial`](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/commits/greenkeeper/initial) branch, it’s possible that you don’t have CI set up yet. We recommend using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), but Greenkeeper will work with every other CI service as well.

If you _have_ already set up a CI for this repository, you might need to check how it’s configured. Make sure it is set to run on all new branches. If you don’t want it to run on absolutely every branch, you can whitelist branches starting with `greenkeeper/`.

Once you have installed and configured CI on this repository correctly, you’ll need to re-trigger Greenkeeper’s initial pull request. To do this, please click the 'fix repo' button on [account.greenkeeper.io](https://account.greenkeeper.io).

217,Connect to a remote UCSC hub,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-03-20T18:30:33Z,2019-04-10T19:34:01Z,2019-04-10T19:33:34Z,"This adds the ability to ""connect"" to remote UCSC track hubs. When the config is loaded or a connection is added, the connections (stored in ""connections"" in the root config) are retrieved and the tracks/assemblies added to a root config entry called ""volatile,"" which is excluded from export when using the ""Download configuration"" button. (Too confusing with MST volatile state? Couldn't decide on a good name.)

There's a new config in the config switcher that demonstrates this with a connection to a little volvox hub I set up.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25592344/54708880-b76b3480-4b1a-11e9-8e30-d94f302aacea.png)

I had to change several things in the track selector and data hub manager drawer widgets, and converting them to use react hooks actually made those changes easier, so I did that as well. Testing with hooks is still a bit tricky, though, since React is [still working on some updates](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14769#issuecomment-474656273) to make testing hooks with async actions work. This means that the tests for the data hub manager are a bit unfinished, as I couldn't get them to work (I think they will after react releases their updates).

That being said, I found a couple blog posts on testing React ([here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details) and [here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/react-hooks-whats-going-to-happen-to-my-tests)) that made me realize my prior Enzyme tests were testing implementation details and not the actual function of my components. The author of those posts has a library called [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/react) that helps write tests that don't test implementation details, which I try out here (but which still don't quite work because of the above-mentioned React problems).

resolves #139
Still need to implement copying remote tracks to local config (#140) and track config overrides (#141)"

214,required and optional config slots,open,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-03-19T14:27:21Z,2021-05-05T17:52:53Z,,"Add support for config slots that are required, and ones that are optional.

Initial ideas for this:

config slots that are required just don't have a defaultValue, and getConf will throw if a read is attempted from them and they are unset.

config slots that are optional will return `undefined` from a getConf, and the graphical config editor will need to have ""+"" and ""-"" or ""add"" and ""delete"" buttons or similar controls to change the slot between set and unset.

213,Support YAML configs?,open,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-03-18T15:10:12Z,2020-10-07T21:02:24Z,,"We're still a ways off from needing to worry about this, but I wanted to get this issue down while I was thinking about it.

Supporting YAML config files (in addition to JSON) might be nice, since YAML and JSON can be inter-converted without loss of data and YAML has some nice features, such as:
- **Multiline strings:** Using the YAML `|-` syntax, a string can span multiple lines, making callback functions defined in the config file easier to read. Example:
```json
{
   ""renderers"":{
      ""PileupRenderer"":{
         ""type"":""PileupRenderer"",
         ""alignmentColor"":""function(feature) {\n  var s = feature.get('strand');\n  return s === '-' || s === -1 ? 'blue': 'red'\n}""
      },
      ""SvgFeatureRenderer"":{
         ""type"":""SvgFeatureRenderer"",
         ""labels"":{}
      }
   }
}
```
becomes
```yaml
renderers:
  PileupRenderer:
    type: PileupRenderer
    alignmentColor: |-
      function(feature) {
        var s = feature.get('strand');
        return s === '-' || s === -1 ? 'blue': 'red'
      }
  SvgFeatureRenderer:
    type: SvgFeatureRenderer
    labels: {}
```
- **Comments:** Comments are natively supported in YAML, which makes it easier to e.g. document an example config file
```yaml
renderers:
  # This is valid in YAML
  PileupRenderer:
    type: PileupRenderer

169,Clarify deps and devDeps,closed,,,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,garrettjstevens,2019-02-27T19:05:05Z,2019-03-01T23:51:51Z,2019-03-01T23:51:51Z,"Here's the best TL;DR I could think of:
- All `dependencies` go in `<root>/packages/<package>/package.json`
- All `devDependencies` go in `<root>/package.json`

Or saying it a different way:
- `<root>/package.json` should only list devDependencies and no dependencies
- `<root>/packages/<package>/package.json` should only list dependencies and no devDependencies

Adding a bit more information:
- `dependencies` are any NPM package `import`ed or `require`d in a package's `src/` directory _except for any `*test.js` files, which follow the next rule_
- `devDependencies` are any NPM package `import`ed or `require`d in any other files and not already in `dependencies`

To add NPM packages:
- `dependencies`: from root directory run `cd packages/<package> && yarn add <npm_package_name>`
- `devDependencies`: from root directory run `yarn add --dev -W <npm_package_name>`

I'd like to disallow running `yarn add --dev` in any individual package's directory, but I can't find any yarn hooks or anything that would facilitate that. Plus that doesn't cover hand-editing the package.json. Maybe a git hook that tests for the presence of `devDependencies` in `package.json`, or is that overkill?

@rbuels I'll add this to the README, but what parts do you think need clarification/fixing?"

161,Add parsers to monorepo (or another monorepo)?,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2019-02-25T19:17:38Z,2019-04-03T22:29:08Z,2019-04-03T22:29:08Z,"After having to address an issue in some of our parsers, I feel like moving the parsers to this (or another) monorepo might be a good idea. Here are some advantages I see:
- Easier to keep track of: You can just clone one repo and get all the packages. Also, if you have a fix for the packages, it's less easy to accidentally forget one.
- Better dependency management: Everything uses the same version of babel, jest, eslint, etc., as well as using the same rules (everything would share the same eslint config, babel config, etc.)  Also much more DRY.
- Better release management: lerna provides a consistent way to release all packages.

Some cons:

- Could be confusing at first: would need to make sure the README in the root was descriptive or had good links to the READMEs in the individual packages
- Issues would all be in a single github repo instead of individual repos (could also be a pro)

Just to clarify, I don't foresee changing anything on the NPM side, so all of the packages would be exactly the same if you were installing them from NPM

Also, having parsers grouped into the jbrowse-components repo or their own repo (maybe a `gmod-utils` repo?) have different advantages. If they were in the jbrowse-components repo, you could modify a parser and your local version of jbrowse2 would automatically pull in those changes, so testing would be easy. I think I'm leaning toward creating a separate monorepo for them, though, since they are logically tied together, but not necessarily to jbrowse2, and they already almost all share a very similar architecture, so it would be a very clean monorepo. And in 15 years when jbrowse3 is rewritten again as a virtual reality genome browser :smirk:, we won't have to pull the parsers out of the jbrowse2 monorepo."

Track overrides can be applied and persisted. A user edited configuration for a track can be saved in localstorage. On refresh, a track override is applied and gets a indicator such as a red icon. That override can be ""thrown away"" or reverted with a trash icon or similar

JBrowse admins can hardcode track overrides in the config that applies to tracks loaded from a track hub remotely. The user edited track overrides can be applied over the admins track overrides

We discussed how possibly we need to have ""read only"" tracks that need cloning to create user edits, but after discussion this seemed to be not a strict requirement.

118,Side scrolling performance improvements on chrome,closed,,,cmdcolin,,,2019-02-01T23:18:22Z,2019-04-19T19:35:41Z,2019-04-19T19:35:41Z,"Side scrolling on chrome is generally quite fast, however if you quickly side scroll then there are blank white blocks for awhile until it is able to re-render. The sequence track is slightly better than the other tracks in load time, but I think all tracks should be a bit more performant.  I have not done profiling to see what the issue is, so I am not sure the key area to target

See  attached video
[screencast-localhost-3000-2019.02.01-18-12-04.zip](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/files/2823654/screencast-localhost-3000-2019.02.01-18-12-04.zip)

This is of course nitpicky but I think it could look smoother and would look really good if data was already loaded as you were scrolling

Note that scrolling back over areas you have already seen have this issue too so it's not necessarily like a ""first time the data is loading"" thing...should be in a cache already."

@rbuels one problem in particular is that since the adapters are in a web worker, they don't ""observe"" the MST root. This means that any editing of assemblies gets stored in the root model, but the adapters that already exist don't change to reflect that. Is there some way to re-initialize the adapters currently in use?

Individual adapters will only have to provide an array of reference sequences names they use, and everything else will be handled by the base class. Each individual adapter should implement:

- `loadData` this is where any metadata loading, etc. should happen and should return a promise for an array of reference sequence names
- `getFeaturesInRegion` returns a promise for an Observable, same as before. Does not need to do anything with assemblyName, as that is handled in the base class
- `freeResources` not used in any of our adapters yet

I've updated the BamAdapter and TwoBitAdapter to use this model, so you can look at those for an example.

I've got a couple mostly code-style-related suggestions, but didn't want to commit directly to your PR. In keeping with [this advice](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/faq/#when-should-i-use-inline-style-vs-classes), I've been trying to use the inline `style` prop only for dynamic style properties and use `classNames` with a styles class for other things. This particular file is a bit of an exception since I've left the `grid`-related stuff (event the static stuff) all in the `style` props just to keep it all together and easier to read, but I've still tried to keep everything else using the JSS styles with `classNames`.

I also added just a little bit of padding to the right of the zoom controls since it was causing a bit of horizontal overflow in my browser."

91,An in-range update of material-ui is breaking the build 🚨,closed,,,greenkeeper[bot],,,2019-01-26T14:14:07Z,2019-02-07T17:48:43Z,2019-02-07T17:48:43Z,"
## There have been updates to the *material-ui* monorepo:

 + - The `dependency` [@material-ui/core](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) was updated from `3.9.0` to `3.9.1`.
- The `dependency` [@material-ui/lab](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) was updated from `3.0.0-alpha.28` to `3.0.0-alpha.29`.


🚨 [View failing branch](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/compare/master...GMOD:greenkeeper%2Fdefault%2Fmonorepo.material-ui-20190126140954).

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build failed**.

This monorepo update includes releases of one or more dependencies which all belong to the [material-ui group definition](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/monorepo-definitions).


material-ui is a direct dependency of this project, and **it is very likely causing it to break**. If other packages depend on yours, this update is probably also breaking those in turn.

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for jbrowse-components :muscle:

🔒 Greenkeeper has found a `yarn.lock` file in this repository. Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.

**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.



📦 📦  Greenkeeper has detected multiple `package.json` files. They have all been added to a new `greenkeeper.json` config file. They’ve been collected in a group called `default`, meaning that all of them will receive updates together. You can rename, add and remove groups and freely assign each `package.json` to whichever group you like. It’s common, for example, to have one `frontend` group and one `backend` group, each with a couple of `package.json` files. In any case, all files in a group will have their updates collected into single PRs and issues.

<summary>💥 Tests on this branch are failing. Here’s how to proceed.</summary>

To solve the issue, first find out which of the dependency’s updates is causing the problem. Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Then push your changes to this branch and merge it.

<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

To make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]

<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components.git greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>

After you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

The above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

However, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.

This way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

This means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.

These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:

To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.

```js
jbrowse.configure({
  views: {
    LinearGenomeView: {},
  },
})
```
and then run `getSnapshot(MODEL.configuration.views)` you can see that the state is
```json
{
   ""LinearGenomeView"":{
      ""_configId"":""mk6EmWpndk""
   }
}
```
This sometimes causes an error that says: `Uncaught Error: [mobx-state-tree] A map of objects containing an identifier should always store the object under their own identifier. Trying to store key 'mk6EmWpndk', but expected: 'LinearGenomeView'`. You can fix this by manually specifying the `_configId` like I did in this PR. However, it seems like we would want it to automatically take care of that so we don't have to worry about specifying the `_configId` every time a view is configured. I tried to put a check in `ConfigurationSchema()` from `configurationSchema.js` to see if the config was for a view and then set the `_configId` to the view name instead of a random ID, but I couldn't figure out a way to tell from there whether the config was for a view or not. If you know a good way of doing that, that would probably be a better way of fixing the problem than this PR.

Note, if you just run `jbrowse.configure()` and then run `model.addView('LinearGenomeView')`, it doesn't have any problems since `addView` explicitly sets the `_configId` to the view name."

I know we mentioned it in the planning session back in Sept, but I don't remember what we decided.

One feature I can think of that would be useful is to use subtracks to apply settings to a bunch of tracks at once. For example, the parent track would basically just be a ""folder"" to put other tracks in, and any configs applied to the parent track would apply to all the subtracks.

23,Manage drawer and track widths,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2018-11-27T20:20:21Z,2018-11-27T21:05:52Z,2018-11-27T21:05:52Z,"This is pretty much done in 1b2190043c78b2db4c1234a550b38193d1aa0f8e, just needs some tests. The drawer defaults to 25% of the window width, and the tracks automatically fill up the remaining space. The drawer can be dragged to resize it, and when the window is resized it tries to keep the drawer approximately the same proportion of the window width.

Possible idea: having an option where the drawer is disabled, but can still be temporarily rendered as some sort of pop-over in response to something like the ""select tracks"" button being clicked."

19,Get hierarchical track selector to display dummy text,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2018-11-15T18:42:54Z,2018-11-15T22:09:38Z,2018-11-15T21:55:30Z,"@rbuels I decided I'm going to worry about the drawer and track positioning later and just get the components themselves working first. I want to try to get my changes merged with yours fairly often, though, so we can stay on the same page. This change just adds the drawer and enough stuff to just have the track selector display some dummy text. I'll start working on getting proper state for it next."
18,Add app bar menu with mst store,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2018-11-05T17:26:24Z,2018-12-10T15:17:24Z,2018-11-19T19:11:56Z,"@rbuels hopefully your branch hasn't diverged too much from this. I tried to alter your changes as little as possible and just add in stuff for some UI elements. I did make one change, though: at the bottom of `JBrowse.js` I switched out
```html
<App getViewType={this.getViewType} rootModel={this.model} />
```
for
```html
<Provider rootModel={this.model}>
  <App getViewType={this.getViewType} />
</Provider>
```

So that way any downstream component can grab the state by using something like
```js
@inject('rootModel')
@observer
class SomeComponentHere extends Component {}
```
which will cause `rootModel` to be inserted in to that component's `props`."

With [dynamic imports](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/05/18/whats-new-in-create-react-app.html#code-splitting-with-dynamic-import), we can at least load custom React components, which is a good start.

8,Update to create-react-app 2.0.3,closed,,,garrettjstevens,,,2018-10-09T17:13:51Z,2018-10-09T17:54:31Z,2018-10-09T17:54:28Z,"I mostly ended up rebuilding the app with 2.0.3 and then adding in our ESLint, webworker, and other stuff. Doesn't seem to be an easy way to bring in the changes otherwise (CRA docs confirm this). Basic idea is:
* Create a new CRA project
* Eject the project
* Compare all the files to the ones in the existing project and bring in changes that don't conflict with ones we've made
  * Right now we've added the webworker code to `config/webpack.config.dev.js` and `config/webpack.config.prod.js`, as well as the workaround in ""output:"" in those files to get webworkers to work.
  * package.json is the tricky one to do, since it's hard to tell what CRA changed and what we added manually.

On another note, I'm guessing that CRA doesn't support webworkers right now because Webpack4 has trouble with them (https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6525). I bet once that gets resolved it will support webworkers and we might be able to un-eject.
